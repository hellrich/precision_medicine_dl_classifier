The tumors have relatively low malignant potential and unlikely proceed to metastasis formation. The lesions may occur in an isolated form or in ca. 40% of cases may be associated with genetic abnormalities, by and large Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and Carney complex. At presentation, 20% of LCCSCT cases are bilateral and/or multifocal. Owning to characteristic skin lesions and particular hyperechoic ultrasound image of the tumor, preliminary diagnosis of the syndromic LCCSCT is possible in the preoperative period. Consequently, testicle organ-sparing procedure can be attempted, which is especially justified in bilateral lesions. Here, we report a case of a bilateral LCCSCT in a 20-year-old man with atypical Peutz-Jeghers syndrome due to amplification of the exon 1 of STK11 gene who was successfully treated with bilateral testicle-sparing tumorectomies.","title":"Organ-sparing surgery of the bilateral testicular large cell calcifying sertoli cell tumor in patient with atypical Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.","pubmedId":"22160729"}
