The serum Lipid profile was studied on 10 healthy normotensive nondiabetic subject, on 10 patients suffering from hypertension with type II diabetes mellitus and on 10 patients suffering from type II diabetes mellitus without hypertension. In present study a significantly higher level of serum total cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL-Cholesterol concentration were observed in hypertensive type II diabetes mellitus and normotensive type II diabetes mellitus subjects in comparison to control group and serum HDL-cholesterol concentration was significantly lower in both the groups in comparison to healthy control. There was significantly increased level of serum total cholesterol (P \u003c 0.001) and LDL-cholesterol (P \u003c 0.001) in hypertensive type II diabetes mellitus in comparison to normotensive type II diabetes mellitus. Though serum triglyceride level was increased in hypertensive type II diabetes mellitus in comparison to normotensive type II diabetes mellitus, but it was not statistically significant. Serum HDL-cholesterol level was more in normotensive type II diabetes mellitus in comparison to hypertensive type II diabetes mellitus group but it was not statistically significant.","title":"Serum lipid profile in hypertensive and normotensive type II diabetes mellitus patients--a comparative study.","pubmedId":"12715635"}
