Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA were used to establish two TP53 mutations (7.4%): a point mutation and a 63-bp duplication. Amplification of the MDM2 gene was observed in two tumors (7.4%) by means of Southern-blot analysis, one of them also carrying the TP53 point mutation. Immunohistochemical and Western-blot techniques were used to study nuclear accumulation of p53 and mdm2 proteins: 11 cases (40.7%) with p53 protein expression and thirteen cases (48.1%) with mdm2 protein expression were detected. We confirmed overexpression of mdm2 protein in eight of ten cases (80%) with p53 protein expression without TP53 gene mutation. Statistical analysis shows that simultaneous co-expression of p53 and mdm2 in malignant fibrous histiocytoma is significantly correlated with survival in absence of gene alteration in contrast to the lack of statistical correlation with survival of p53 protein expression alone.","title":"Analysis of p53 and mdm2 proteins in malignant fibrous histiocytoma in absence of gene alteration: prognostic significance.","pubmedId":"10628802"}
