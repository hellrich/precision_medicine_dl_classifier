A point mutation (V600E) in BRAF occurs in a subset of colorectal cancers (CRCs) and is associated with adverse outcome and may predict non response to anti-EGFR antibodies.  Detection of a BRAFV600E mutation in a CRC with microsatellite instability indicates a sporadic origin and excludes Lynch Syndrome.  While BRAFV600E mutation status is determined using a DNA-based assay, antibodies against the BRAFV600E protein have recently been developed.  We examined mutant BRAFV600E protein expression and its concordance with mutation status.   Methods:  Primary stage III colon carcinomas (50 BRAFV600E mutation carriers and 25 wild-type cases) were studied from a completed phase III adjuvant trial comparing FOLFOX +/- cetuximab (NCCTG N0147).  In archival resection specimens, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using a pan-BRAF antibody and a V600E mutation-specific antibody raised against an immunogenic synthetic peptide derived from the internal region of the BRAFV600E protein.  BRAFV600E mutations in codon 15 were analyzed in extracted DNA using a multiplex, allele specific PCRbased assay.  BRAF staining was scored independently by two pathologists blinded to mutation status. Results:   In primary colon carcinomas stained with a pan-BRAF antibody, diffuse cytoplasmic staining for BRAF proteins was detected in 74 of 75 carcinomas with one case deemed non-evaluable. Using the mutation-specific BRAFV600E antibody, diffuse cytoplasmic staining was detected in 49 of 74 tumors without appreciable heterogeneity of expression.  Among these 49 tumors expressing mutant BRAFV600E proteins, all (100%) were found to carry a BRAFV600E mutation according to a DNA-based assay.  In contrast, absent BRAFV600E staining was observed in all 25 tumors that were found to have wild-type copies of BRAFV600E detected using a PCR-based assay. Conclusions:  For the detection of mutant BRAFV600E, complete concordance was found between IHC and a DNA-based method in colon carcinomas.  This finding supports the use of IHC as a simplified strategy to screen CRCs for mutant BRAFV600E proteins in routine clinical practice to inform clinical decision-making.","title":"Detection of the BRAFV600E protein in human colon carcinomas by a mutation-specific antibody.","pubmedId":"ASCO_112943-132"}
