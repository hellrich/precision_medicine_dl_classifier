Cholangiocarcinoma, a malignant cancer of the bile duct, is a relatively rare adenocarcinoma and has a poor prognosis. Few reports have mentioned cutaneous metastases of cholangiocarcinoma, and the most of them were due to direct tumor seeding by percutaneous procedures. Herein, we report a case of cholangiocarcinoma with distant cutaneous metastases in a 60-year-old man.","title":"[Cholangiocarcinoma with distant cutaneous metastases].","pubmedId":"19934617"}
