The frequent genetic mutation found in metastatic melanoma, BRAF(V600E), results in constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.\nIn this study, we utilised genetically engineered melanoma cell lines and xenograft mouse models to investigate how BRAF(V600E) affected cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) expression in tumour cells and in human dermal fibroblasts.\nWe found that BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells expressed higher levels of these cytokines and of MMP-1 than wild-type counterparts. Further, conditioned medium from the BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells promoted the activation of stromal fibroblasts, inducing expression of SDF-1 and its receptor CXCR4. This increase was mitigated when the conditioned medium was taken from melanoma cells treated with the BRAF(V600E) specific inhibitor, vemurafenib.\nOur findings highlight the role of BRAF(V600E) in activating the stroma and suggest a mechanistic link between BRAF(V600E) and MMP-1 in mediating melanoma progression and in activating adjacent fibroblasts in the tumour microenvironment.","title":"BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells secrete factors that activate stromal fibroblasts and enhance tumourigenicity.","pubmedId":"25117819"}
