Several distinct, non-NPM1, ALK fusions have subsequently been described in lymphomas and other tumor types. All of these fusions result in the constitutive expression and activation of ALK and ALK signaling pathways, ultimately leading to the malignant phenotype.\nA non-NPM1 fusion partner of ALK was identified in a 32-year-old Caucasian male ALCL patient whose disease was refractory to standard chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation, and exhibited a poor response to a first-generation ALK inhibitor. Non-allele-specific ALK RT-qPCR revealed ALK overexpression and 5\u0027 RACE PCR revealed that the patient\u0027s lymphoma expressed a TRAF1-ALK fusion.\nWe report the case of an ALCL patient whose tumor harbored the newly recognized TRAF1-ALK fusion and describe the clinical outcome after treatment with an ALK inhibitor. The short survival of our patient may reflect a propensity toward aggressive behavior in lymphomas that express this ALK fusion.","title":"Detection of a TRAF1-ALK fusion in an anaplastic large cell lymphoma patient with chemotherapy and ALK inhibitor-resistant disease.","pubmedId":"26187744"}
