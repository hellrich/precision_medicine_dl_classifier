The patient underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy for control of bleeding from the tumor. Then, low-doses of l-leucovorin (25 mg/body bolus) and 5-FU (500 mg/body/hour) were injected through an injection port every week. After 40 times, CT scanning showed almost a complete response without side effects.","title":"[A case of hepatic metastases of ampullary carcinoma which completely responded to intrahepatic infusion of 5-FU with low-dose l-leucovorin].","pubmedId":"16121924"}
