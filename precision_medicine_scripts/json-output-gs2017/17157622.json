Accurate staging by imaging can have a significant impact on appropriate treatment and surgical options. Familiarity with the different histologic subtypes of lung cancer and the typical and atypical appearances of lung cancer is vital. Radiologists serve a critical role in the diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of patients with lung cancer.","title":"Lung cancer.","pubmedId":"17157622"}
