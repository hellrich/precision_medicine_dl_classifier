Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression is increased at the RNA and protein levels in most human pancreatic cancers. The purpose of this trial was to determine whether the addition of a COX-2 inhibitor to chemotherapy was beneficial. To date, 11 patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer have been treated with the combination of gemcitabine (Gemzar), irinotecan (Camptosar), and celecoxib (Celebrex) at 400 mg orally twice daily. Encouraging pain relief, improvement in performance status, and decreases in CA 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen levels have been observed.","title":"Gemcitabine/Irinotecan/celecoxib in pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"15685834"}
