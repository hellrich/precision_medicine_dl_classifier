There are currently no established targeted therapies that take advantage of SqCCL-specific genetic abnormalities.  Amplification of the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 1 gene (FGFR1) has been identified as a driver event in breast cancers and in SqCCL. The demographic characteristics and prognosis of patients with these tumors remains to be defined.  Methods:  DNA from 123 surgically resected, fresh frozen, and clinically annotated SqCCLs was extracted using a resin-based or phenol-based  methodology.  DNA quantity and quality was assessed using the Quantifiler kit (ABI).  Specimen histology was validated, and the proportion of tumor cells was \u003e60%.  Copy number variation (CNV) analysis was performed using quantitative PCR with primers specific for exons 12 and 16 of FGFR1 and data analysis using CopyCaller (ABI).  Samples with a predicted CNV of at 2 or greater in at least one exon were scored as amplified.   Chi-squared tests were used to examine clinical and demographic differences between patients with and without amplification of FGFR1.  Survival differences were examined by Kaplan Meier and Cox regression models.   Results:  Men comprised the majority of the population (n\u003d91, 74%) and most cases were pathological stage I (n\u003d75, 61%) or stage II (n\u003d32, 26%).  Thirty (24.4%) tumors showed amplification of FGFR1.  There was no association between amplification and sex (p\u003d0.18) or stage (p\u003d0.37).  The majority of the patients were white (n\u003d114, 92.7%), but the proportion of tumors that were amplified was higher among non-whites (5/9, 55.5%) than whites (25/114, 21.9%, p\u003d0.02).  Overall, median survival was 32.2 months.  In univariate survival analysis, amplification was associated with an increased hazard of death (HR\u003d1.55, Wilcoxon p\u003d0.03).  Tumor stage at diagnosis was also associated with increased risk of death (HR\u003d1.67, p\u003d0.0009).  Only stage remained a significant predictor of death in the multivariate survival models (HR\u003d1.65, p\u003d0.004).  Conclusions:  Somatic amplification of FGFR1 is a relatively common event in SqCCL and may be associated with race and overall survival.","title":"FGFR1 amplification in squamous cell lung cancers.","pubmedId":"ASCO_100227-114"}
