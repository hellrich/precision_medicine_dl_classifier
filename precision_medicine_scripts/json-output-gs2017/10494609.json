Occasionally, this disease is combined with different of probable autoimmune genesis, particularly with ulcerative colitis (\u003e 50%). The reported case describes the rare subsequent development of primary sclerosing cholangitis, ulcerative colitis and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in a 22-year-old male patient. The coincidence of primary sclerosing cholangitis and IDDM supports the assumption of common factors in the etiopathogenesis of both diseases.","title":"[Primary sclerosing cholangitis, ulcerative colitis and type 1 diabetes mellitus].","pubmedId":"10494609"}
