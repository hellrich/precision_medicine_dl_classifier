This study investigated the methylation status of Reprimo and hMLH1 gene in both plasma and tissue samples from gastric cancer patients, in an attempt to investigate their diagnostic implications in gastric cancer. A total of 180 tissue and plasma samples (including 50 cases of gastric cancer, 50 dysplasia, 50 chronic atrophic gastritis with intestinal metaplasia and 30 normal controls) were collected for detecting DNA methylation status of Reprimo and hMLH1 genes using MSP method. Tissue protein expression levels were further tested by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The positive rate of DNA methylation rate was, in ascending sequence, gastritis tissue, dysplasia tissue and gastric carcinoma tissue. All those tissues had significantly elevated DNA methylation level compared to normal group (P \u003c 0.05). Expression level of Reprimo and hMLH1 proteins were, however, decreased in pathological tissues compared to normal ones (P \u003c 0.05). A significantly negative relationship existed between protein level and promoter region methylation level. The DNA methylation occurred in promoter regions of both Reprimo and hMLH1 genes depressed the protein expression, and may participate in the occurrence and progression and gastric cancer. The combined assay of serum Reprimo and hMLH1 DNA methylation levels thus had critical importance in the early diagnosis and gastric cancer.","title":"Implication of Reprimo and hMLH1 gene methylation in early diagnosis of gastric carcinoma.","pubmedId":"26823831"}
