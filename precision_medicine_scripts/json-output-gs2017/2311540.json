The available literature is reviewed and discussed. Although it is very difficult to assess the prognosis and treatment of pharyngeal liposarcomas, it appears that the histologic characteristics of the individual tumor and its location and resectability determine the outcome of treatment. However, because of its rare occurrence clinically, no single institution has been able to gain enough experience to formulate reliable long-term prognoses and therapeutic guidelines.","title":"Primary liposarcoma of the pharynx.","pubmedId":"2311540"}
