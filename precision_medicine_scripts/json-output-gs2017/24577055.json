The association between IL-8 expression, clinicopathological features, KRAS or EGFR mutation status and survival was analysed.\nIL-8 was highly expressed in tumours from elderly patients or smokers and in tumours with pleural involvement or vascular invasion. In a non-smokers\u0027 subgroup, IL-8 level positively correlated with age. IL-8 was highly expressed in tumours with KRAS mutations compared with those with EGFR mutations or wild-type EGFR/KRAS. Lung adenocarcinoma patients with high IL-8 showed significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) than those with low IL8. DFS and OS were significantly shorter in the patients with mutant KRAS/high IL-8 than in those with wild-type KRAS/low IL-8. Cox regression analyses demonstrated that elevated IL-8 expression correlated with unfavourable prognosis.\nOur findings suggest that IL-8 expression is associated with certain clinicopathological features including age and is a potent prognostic marker in lung adenocarcinoma, especially in oncogenic KRAS-driven adenocarcinoma.","title":"Clinicopathological and prognostic significance of interleukin-8 expression and its relationship to KRAS mutation in lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"24577055"}
