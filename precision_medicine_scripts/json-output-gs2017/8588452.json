Surgery took 225 and 275 minutes, respectively. A total of 49 and 27 lymph nodes were resected. Both patients were discharged on postoperative day 5. Preservation of fertility in such young women with early disease seems feasible.","title":"[Preserving fertility in early cervix carcinoma: trachelectomy with laparoscopic lymphadenectomy].","pubmedId":"8588452"}
