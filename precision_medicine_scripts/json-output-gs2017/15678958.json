The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome of surgical treatment and to establish the surgical strategy for lung cancer with IIPs. Twenty-five patients with lung cancer and IIPs who were admitted in our hospital from 1996 to 2004 were examined. Eight patients underwent lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection, while 17 patients underwent limited resection. The actuarial 3-year survival rate was 43%. There were no postoperative acute exacerbation of IIPs. We considered most patients were in a stable state of IIPs preoperatively, and we made effort to treat IIPs with limited resection. The prognosis of IIPs was poor. It is difficult to decide whether to carry out limited resection.","title":"[Lung cancer combined with idiopathic interstitial pneumonias].","pubmedId":"15678958"}
