HSAN IV is characterized by absence of reaction to noxious stimuli, recurrent episodes of fever, anhidrosis, self mutilating behaviour and frequent mental retardation. Mutations in the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 (NTRK1) are associated with this disorder. We investigated NTRK1 mutations in five HSAN IV patients and one less typical patient with hypohidrosis, insensitivity to pain as well as motor- and sensory deficits in the peripheral nervous system. For the HSAN IV patients we identified a homozygous missense mutation (p.I572S), a homozygous deletion of 1985bp (g.7335164-7336545del), a homozygous insertion c.722_723insC in exon 7 and two compound heterozygous mutations (p.Q558X+p.L717R). The less typical patient as well as one HSAN IV patient revealed no NTRK1 mutation.","title":"Novel missense, insertion and deletion mutations in the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 gene (NTRK1) associated with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis.","pubmedId":"18077166"}
