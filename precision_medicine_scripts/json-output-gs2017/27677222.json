These SNPs in the PTEN gene were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and direct sequencing. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was used to evaluate the severity of depression.\nThe C allele of rs701848, the C allele of rs2735343 and the T allele of rs112025902 were associated with an increased risk of depression (odds ratio [OR]\u003d3.814, 95% CI: 3.093-4.703, P\u003c0.001; OR\u003d2.642, 95% CI: 2.152-3.242, P\u003c0.001; OR\u003d2.882, 95% CI: 2.347-3.539, P\u003c0.001; respectively). Depression patients carrying C allele (TC+CC) of rs701848 and carrying T allele (AT+TT) of rs112025902 had higher HAMD total scores and HAMD anxiety factor scores than those carrying TT genotype of rs701848 and carrying AA genotype of rs112025902 (all P\u003c0.05). Furthermore, depression patients carrying C allele (GC+CC) of rs2735343 had lower HAMD total scores and HAMD factors associated with depression scores than those carrying GG genotype (both P\u003c0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that rs701848, rs2735343 and rs112025902 polymorphisms in the PTEN gene may be independent risk factors of depression (relative risk [RR]\u003d1.807, 95% CI\u003d1.023-3.193, P\u003d0.042; RR\u003d1.759, 95% CI\u003d1.033-2.995, P\u003d0.038; RR\u003d1.646, 95% CI\u003d1.018-2.663, P\u003d0.042; respectively).\nOur findings provide evidence that rs701848, rs2735343 and rs112025902 polymorphisms in the PTEN gene may be correlated with the risk of depression and depressive symptoms in the Chinese population.","title":"Correlations of PTEN genetic polymorphisms with the risk of depression and depressive symptoms in a Chinese population.","pubmedId":"27677222"}
