Moderate doses of radiation combined with surgical excision result in optimal local-regional control, good to excellent cosmetic results in the majority of patients and minimal complications. The long-term potential carcinogenic effects of radiation have not materialized in the clinical setting and the incidence of contralateral breast cancer and second non-breast malignancy is comparable to that reported after mastectomy. Based on this data, conservative surgery and radiation continues to represent a valid alternative to mastectomy for the treatment of early breast cancer.","title":"Conservative surgery and radiation in the treatment of early (stages I and II) breast cancer.
