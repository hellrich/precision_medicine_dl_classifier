By conducting population-based analyses in women with both BC and meningioma, hypothesis-generating causal links were pursued.\nUsing the US SEER 18 registry (2004 to 2009), clinicopathologic and demographic characteristics from cohorts of women with only BC (n\u003d279,821) or meningioma (n\u003d19,570) diagnoses were compared with 412 women with both diagnoses (BC-meningioma).\nBC diagnosis preceded meningioma by \u003e2 months in 48% of women; 20% had synchronous (within 2 mo) disease. Median meningioma size was 1.9 and 2.4 cm in the BC-meningioma and meningioma cohorts, respectively (P\u003d0.0009). Among BC-meningioma patients, meningioma size was similar whether diagnosed \u003e2 months prior, synchronously, or \u003e2 months after BC. Meningioma was pathologically confirmed in 38% of BC-meningioma and 51% of meningioma patients. Distribution of BC histologies was comparable in patients with and without meningioma, with ductal type predominating (80% in BC-meningioma, 83% in BC). Although hormone receptor status of invasive BC was not significantly different between BC-meningioma and BC groups, the BC-meningioma cohort had fewer women with ER+/PR+ in situ disease (P\u003d0.006). BC stage among women with meningioma was more advanced versus women with BC only.\nWomen with BC and meningioma have smaller-sized meningiomas and more advanced BCs compared with women having only 1 diagnosis. As there was no temporal relationship between size and latency between tumor diagnoses, the disparity in meningioma size between BC-meningioma and meningioma cohorts may have BC-associated biological components that warrant further study.","title":"Meningioma in Breast Cancer Patients: Population-based Analysis of Clinicopathologic Characteristics.","pubmedId":"24577166"}
