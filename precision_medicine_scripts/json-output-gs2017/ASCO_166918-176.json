Here we report our different results about the detection of MET exon 14 mutation in Chinese patients. Methods: In total, 1101 patients with lung adenocarcinoma has been screened for MET exon 14 mutation. Both NGS and sanger sequencing was used. Moreover IHC and FISH was also performed on the specimens of MET exon 14 mutational patients. Results: 826 of them were detected by NGS and 275 by sanger sequencing. A total of 10 patients have been identified with MET exon 14 mutations which accounted for only 0.91% of lung adenocarcinoma, much less than the western patients data of 3%. Then 6 of MET exon 14 mutational patients have been performed with IHC and FISH. All the detailed data has been presented in Table 1. Furthermore among 2 patients received crizotinib, only 1 patient combined with MET amplification experienced a partial response and PFS has been 9 months. However whether sensitivity to crizotinib in this patient was conferred by the MET exon 14 mutation or by MET amplification is still unclear. For the other one, the disease has progressed in only 1.0 month. Conclusions:MET exon skipping mutation rate is lower and may not a good predictive biomarker for c-MET inhibitor in Chinese lung adenocarcinoma patients.
