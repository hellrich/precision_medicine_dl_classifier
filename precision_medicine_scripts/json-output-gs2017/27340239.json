We evaluated the responses of 757 African-American and 697 Hispanic participants who reported a chronic illness as the biggest health problem in their families.\nWeighted analysis of cross-sectional survey responses from African-American and Hispanic adults.\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics with chronic illness in their families reported experiencing challenges with the health care delivery system, with financial/economic insecurity, and with their communities that may influence how they live with chronic disease.\nPolicymakers and clinicians should be aware that some African-American and Hispanic patients face obstacles within and beyond the health care system that are relevant to how they live with chronic conditions affecting their families. Additional tools and supports may need to be identified and supplied to effectively manage chronic illness in these communities. The payment system for physicians should account for the supplementary supports and services these patients might require.","title":"Challenges confronting African Americans and Hispanics living with chronic illness in their families.","pubmedId":"27340239"}
