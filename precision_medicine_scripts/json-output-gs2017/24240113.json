It thus has a high potential to be a sensitive and specific biomarker. Unfortunately, its low serum level limits its diagnostic/prognostic potential. We here report that a multifaceted acute phase protein lipocalin 2, regulated by MUC4, could be a potential diagnostic/prognostic marker for pancreatic cancer. Experimental Designs and\nOverexpression/knockdown, luciferase reporter and molecular inhibition studies revealed that MUC4 regulates lipocalin 2 by stabilizing HER2 and stimulating AKT, which results in the activation of NF-κB. Immunohistochemical analyses of lipocalin 2 and MUC4 showed a significant positive correlation between MUC4 and lipocalin 2 in primary, metastatic tissues (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.71, P \u003d 0.002) from rapid autopsy tissue sample from patients with pancreatic cancer as well as in serum and tissue samples from spontaneous KRASG(12)D mouse pancreatic cancer model (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.98, P \u003c 0.05). Lipocalin 2 levels increased progressively with disease advancement (344.2 ± 22.8 ng/mL for 10 weeks to 3067.2 ± 572.6 for 50 weeks; P \u003c 0.0001). In human pancreatic cancer cases, significantly elevated levels of lipocalin 2 were observed in patients with pancreatic cancer (148 ± 13.18 ng/mL) in comparison with controls (73.27 ± 4.9 ng/mL, P \u003d 0.014). Analyses of pre- and postchemotherapy patients showed higher lipocalin 2 levels in prechemotherapy patients [121.7 ng/mL; 95% confidence interval (CI), 98.1-150.9] in comparison with the postchemotherapy (92.6 ng/mL; 95% CI, 76.7-111.6; P \u003d 0.06) group.\nThis study delineates the association and the downstream mechanisms of MUC4-regulated elevation of lipocalin-2 (via HER2/AKT/NF-κB) and its clinical significance for prognosis of pancreatic cancer.","title":"MUC4-mediated regulation of acute phase protein lipocalin 2 through HER2/AKT/NF-κB signaling in pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"24240113"}
