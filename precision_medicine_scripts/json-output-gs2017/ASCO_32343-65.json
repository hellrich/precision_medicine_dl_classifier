Following progression upon first-line therapy, pts may be switched to lapatinib. Others however may be candidates for continued antibody therapy. Finding the optimal treatment approach therefore is pertinent. Here, we aimed to identify factors predicting response to second-line T-based therapy. Methods: 80 pts (median age 50.5 years) with ABC treated with \u003e1 line of T-containing therapy were identified from a breast cancer database. HER-2-status was determined by immunohistochemistry (HercepTest) and re-analyzed by FISH if a score of 2+ was gained. Response rate (RR; CR+PR), clinical benefit rate (CBR; CR+PR+SD \u003e6 months), time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), and cardiac toxicity were recorded. Response was evaluated every three months (m) using UICC criteria. TTP and OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. In order to identify factors associated with TTP, the following variables were included in a Cox regression model: age (65 y/\u003e65 y), initial tumor stage (\u003cIV/IV), grading, ductal/lobular carcinoma, endocrine receptor status, prior non T-containing palliative chemotherapy, metastatic sites (visceral/non-visceral only), and clinical benefit (CB) from T-based first-line therapy. The same variables were used in a multinomial logistic regression model to evaluate their influence on treatment response. P values \u003c0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. Results: Median time of observation was 28 m. TTP was median 9.3 m (95% CI 7.73-10.96) in the first-line and 7.5 m (95% CI 6.14-8.82) in the second-line setting (n.s.). First-line treatment yielded an 83% CBR, as compared to 54% in second-line. None of the factors included in the multivariate model independently predicted outcome. A significant deterioration of cardiac function was observed in a single patient; 22.5% developed brain metastases. Conclusions: T in multiple lines showed considerable activity. None of the variables investigated could independently predict response to second-line therapy. In order to reliably predict activity of second-line T-based therapy evaluation of other factors such as truncated HER2 or PTEN-loss appears necessary.","title":"Predicting response to second-line trastuzumab-based therapy in patients (pts) with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer (ABC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_32343-65"}
