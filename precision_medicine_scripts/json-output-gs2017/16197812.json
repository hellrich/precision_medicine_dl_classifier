In this study, we used DNA microarray assay, which detects numerous genetic abnormalities simultaneously and analyses a global assessment of molecular events in meningioma cells. We studied 31 meningiomas by GenoSensor Array 300 in order to detect the chromosomal aberrations and genetic abnormalities in the whole genome.\nThis study demonstrated not only classical chromosomal aberration, such as loss of chromosome 22q in 19 meningiomas (61.3%), but also new genetic characteristics of meningiomas, such as amplification of MSH2 in 16 meningiomas (51.6%), deletion of GSCL in 13 meningiomas (41.9%) and deletion of HIRA in seven meningiomas (22.6%).\nThese results suggest that DNA microarray assay is useful in research for the genetic characters of meningiomas and understanding tumorigenesis.","title":"Chromosomal and genetic abnormalities in benign and malignant meningiomas using DNA microarray.","pubmedId":"16197812"}
