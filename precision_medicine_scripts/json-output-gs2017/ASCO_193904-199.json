However, cervical cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related death in SSA due in part to a lack of accessible screening and treatment options. Methods: The DHS is a nationally representative household survey designed by ICF International and typically implemented every 5 years. In addition to demographic characteristics, select surveys collect data on cervical cancer awareness and screening. We included women aged 21 years from Cte d\u0027Ivoire, Kenya, Namibia, and Zimbabwe who participated in the DHS. After sample weights were applied, we used logistic regression to examine associations of demographics and national cervical cancer incidence (as per the International Agency on Research on Cancer) with cervical cancer screening. Factors with p \u003c 0.20 in bivariate analyses were included in a multivariate model. Results: We analyzed data from 45,947 women aged 21 to 49 years (mean \u003d 32.2); 69% were married with an average of 3 children. Nearly half had completed secondary education (47%), 73% were literate, and 48% belonged to the highest two wealth quintiles. Over 70% of women were aware of cervical cancer; 24% of all women reported a previous screening exam with variation by country. Namibia, with the highest rates of screening (46%), had the lowest incidence. In multivariate analyses, cervical cancer screening was associated with increasing age (OR \u003d 1.06; CI \u003d 1.05, 1.07), education (OR \u003d 1.48; CI \u003d 1.30, 1.69), literacy (OR \u003d 1.80; CI \u003d 1.53, 2.13), and wealth (OR \u003d 1.14; CI \u003d 1.09, 1.20). Higher cervical cancer incidence at the national level (OR \u003d .980; CI \u003d .976, .983) and rural residence (OR \u003d .839; CI \u003d .738, .953) were inversely associated with odds of cervical cancer screening. Conclusions: Based on DHS data from four SSA countries, awareness of cervical cancer is high, but receipt of cervical cancer screening is low and may be associated with reductions in cervical cancer incidence. Targeted efforts to increase utilization of cervical cancer screening in SSA are warranted to reduce the preventable burden of cervical cancer.","title":"Correlates of cervical cancer screening from four Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries: Results from the Demographic Health Survey (DHS)2013-2015.","pubmedId":"ASCO_193904-199"}
