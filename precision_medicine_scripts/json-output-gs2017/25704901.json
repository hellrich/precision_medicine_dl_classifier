These alterations have been defined as \"driver mutations\", such as mutations in EGFR and EML4-ALK fusion gene, and are highly sensitive to specific therapies. Other targets have also been identified recently. Personalized medicine is now a reality for patients with advanced NSCLC on the basis of routine screening for EGFR, HER2, KRAS, BRAF, PI3KCA mutations and EML4-ALK rearrangement. This article describes identified biomarkers, available targeted therapies, and the main clinical research approaches in NSCLC.
