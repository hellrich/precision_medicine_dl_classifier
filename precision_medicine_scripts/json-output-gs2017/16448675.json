We evaluated the effect of polymorphisms in four insulin-related genes (G972R in IRS1, G1057D in IRS2, a CA repeat in IGFI and an A/C polymorphism at -202 of IGFBP3) on the risk of microsatellite instability and KRAS2 and TP53 mutations in a population-based set of 1788 cases of colon cancer and 1981 controls. The GR/RR IRS1 genotypes were associated with an increased risk of colon cancers with the KRAS2 G12D mutation (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.5, 3.5 versus controls, OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1, 2.6 versus KRAS2 wild type), the \"no 192\" IGFI genotype increased the risk of the KRAS2 G13D mutation (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2, 4.2 versus controls, OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1, 4.0 versus wild type), and the DD IRS2 genotype increased the risk of the G12V KRAS2 mutation (OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.9, 3.5 versus controls, OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0, 4.0 versus wild type). Polymorphisms in IRS1 and IGF1 were also associated with an approximately two-fold increased risk of specific TP53 mutations relative to controls without cancer. We conclude that polymorphisms in some insulin-related genes are associated with an increased risk of colon cancer with specific KRAS2 and TP53 mutations, implying a link between these genetic changes and specific mutational pathways in carcinogenesis.","title":"Polymorphisms in insulin-related genes predispose to specific KRAS2 and TP53 mutations in colon cancer.","pubmedId":"16448675"}
