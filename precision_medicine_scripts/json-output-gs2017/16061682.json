Towards this end, we have investigated the effects of a representative Hsp90 inhibitor, 17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17DMAG), on the radiosensitivity of a panel of human tumor cell lines. 17DMAG was previously shown to enhance the radiosensitivity of a number of human cell lines, which correlated with the loss of ErbB2. We now report on cell lines in which 17DMAG induced the degradation of ErbB2, yet had no effect on radiosensitivity. In a comparison of ErbB family members, ErbB3 protein was only detectable in cells resistant to 17DMAG-induced radiosensitization. To determine whether ErbB3 plays a casual role in this resistance, short interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to knockdown ErbB3 in the resistant cell line AsPC1. Whereas individual treatments with siRNA to ErbB3 or 17DMAG had no effect on radiosensitivity, the combination, which reduced both ErbB2 and ErbB3, resulted in a significant enhancement in AsPC1 radiosensitivity. In contrast to siRNA to ErbB3 or 17DMAG treatments only, AsPC1 cell exposure to the combination also resulted in a decrease in ErbB1 kinase activity. These results indicate that ErbB3 expression predicts for tumor cell susceptibility to and suggests that the loss of ErbB1 signaling activity is necessary for 17DMAG-induced radiosensitization. However, for cell lines sensitized by 17DMAG, treatment with siRNA to ErbB2, which reduced ErbB1 activity, had no effect on radiosensitivity. These results suggest that, whereas the loss of ErbB1 signaling may be necessary for 17DMAG-induced radiosensitization, it is not sufficient.","title":"ErbB3 expression predicts tumor cell radiosensitization induced by Hsp90 inhibition.","pubmedId":"16061682"}
