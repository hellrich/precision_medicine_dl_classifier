However, current understanding of CRC in YAs is inadequate, especially that of sporadic onset. We conducted a study to describe the landscape of genomic alterations in YA CRC pts presenting to a large academic practice. Methods: Adult pts with CRC presenting to The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center oncology clinics were offered next generation sequencing (NGS) through a customized 22-gene Ion AmpliSeq Mutation Panel as part of clinical care. Commonly mutated areas of select genes (including AKT1, ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2/4, FBXW7, FGFR1/2/3, KRAS/NRAS, MET, NOTCH1, PIK3CA, PTEN, TP53) were sequenced from tumor sections. Institutional review board approval was obtained to retrospectively analyze this NGS testing between 1/2013-3/2016. Results: 258 CRC pts underwent genomic profiling. 57 pts (22.1%) were YAs at diagnosis (range 22-49 years); 20 pts (7.8%) were 40 years old or younger. 31 YA pts (54.4%) had metastatic disease. Of the YAs with CRC, 18 pts (31.6%) were diagnosed with R-sided colon, 16 pts (28.1%) with L-sided colon, and 22 pts (38.6%) with rectal cancer. 110 genomic alterations were found in YA pts, with a mean of 1.9 mutations per tumor (range 0-6); 35 (31.8%) of these in 32 (56.1%) YA pts were actionable. Of these 110 alterations, 41.8% were in TP53, 28.2% in KRAS/NRAS, 10.0% in PIK3CA, 3.6% in BRAF, 3.6% in FBXW7, and 2.73% in PTEN. 6 YA pts (10.5%) had microsatellite instability (MSI-H). Only 1 pt had concomitant MSI-H and a BRAF mutation; 4 pts with BRAF mutations were microsatellite stable. Comparing our YA pts to a separate cohort of pts age \u003e 50 who had testing done, no significant difference was seen in mutation incidence in KRAS/NRAS (p \u003d 1.0), TP53 (p \u003d 0.3), PIK3CA (p \u003d 0.128), or BRAF (p \u003d 1.0). Conclusions: Genomic profiling through a targeted NGS panel is feasible as part of routine clinical practice. There is disagreement in the literature on genetic mutations in YA compared to older age CRC pts. Knowledge of the genomic landscape in YAs with CRC will lead to improved understanding of the underlying biology of CRC in YAs as it differs from CRC in older pts, and could impact future care of this cohort.","title":"Genomic profiling of young adults with colorectal cancer: A single-institution experience.","pubmedId":"ASCO_190873-199"}
