In 10% to 20% of ALCLs, the translocation partners of the ALK gene are genes other than NPM (variant translocations). ALK gene expression limited to the cytoplasm implies a variant translocation. In this study, we have investigated 46 cases of ALCL for expression and localization of ALK protein and its association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (by hybridization to EBV-encoded nuclear RNA-1 [EBER-1] and immunostaining for LMP-1). ALCL patients with a null cell phenotype were significantly younger as compared with those of T-cell phenotype (mean age: 28 years v 42 years; P \u003d.018). Sixteen of 46 ALCL cases (34%) were ALK positive. ALK-positive patients were significantly younger (mean age: 25 years for those with both cytoplasmic and nuclear staining; 22 years for those with exclusive cytoplasmic staining; and 41 years for those negative for the ALK gene; P \u003d.023). EBER-1 was detected in 9 of 46 cases (20%), and LMP-1 expression was noted in 5 of them. By polymerase chain reaction analysis, all EBV-associated cases that were investigated showed type I EBV. Whereas 2 of 23 T-cell ALCLs (9%) were EBER-1+, and 7 of 23 null-cell ALCLs (30%) showed EBV association (P \u003d.057). EBV association was seen in 20% of ALK-negative cases, in 0% of cases with ALK gene expression in both nucleus and cytoplasm, and in 60% of cases with ALK gene expression exclusively in the cytoplasm (P \u003d.02). Further, although ALK-positive-EBER-1+ cases were LMP-1 negative, ALK-negative-EBER-1+ cases were LMP-1 positive. Our study raises the question whether EBV might have an etiological role in the evolution of ALCLs that lack classical t(2;5).","title":"Epstein-Barr virus association and ALK gene expression in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.","pubmedId":"11957137"}
