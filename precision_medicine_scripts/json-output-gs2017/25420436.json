We report the successful application of a vaginal radical trachelectomy (VRT) during pregnancy to treat a patient diagnosed with early stage cervical cancer and subsequently review the published work. A 22-year-old female diagnosed at the gestational age of 17 weeks with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB1 squamous cell cervical carcinoma was treated with VRT at 19(+5) weeks. At 36 weeks, the patient underwent a scheduled cesarean section. A healthy male infant was delivered with a weight of 2795 g. After 13 months of follow-up, the patient is doing well with no evidence of recurrent disease.","title":"Trachelectomy during pregnancy: what has experience taught us?","pubmedId":"25420436"}
