The specificity of neurotrophin action is determined by their selective interaction with the different members of the Trk family; TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC serve as cognate receptors for nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), respectively. Unlike nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, NT-3 can to some extent also bind and activate non-cognate TrkA and B receptors, although the physiological relevance of these interactions is unclear. Previous studies established that neurotrophins use an extended surface for binding to cognate Trk receptors, while binding to p75LNGFR is mediated by a localized cluster of positively charged residues. Here we show that the binding site of NT-3 to its non-preferred receptors TrkA and TrkB is dominated by two positively charged residues, Arg-31 and His-33, previously shown to constitute a main determinant of binding to p75LNGFR. Simultaneous mutation of these two residues into Ala completely abolished NT-3 binding and signaling through TrkA and greatly diminished binding and activation of TrkB. However, NT-3 binding and signaling through its cognate receptor TrkC was unaffected by the mutation. These results show that binding of NT-3 to p75LNGFR, TrkA, and TrkB is mediated by a common determinant, which is distinct from that recognized by TrkC and also different and more localized than the one recognized by TrkA and TrkB in their cognate ligands. Thus, although homologous regions in all neurotrophins are used for binding to Trk receptors, a given Trk may actually contact different residues in different neurotrophins. The mutant NT-3 described here may be of greater advantage than native NT-3 when a trophic activity needs to be specifically targeted to TrkC-expressing neurons and provides a monospecific neurotrophin for future therapeutic development.","title":"Binding of neurotrophin-3 to p75LNGFR, TrkA, and TrkB mediated by a single functional epitope distinct from that recognized by trkC.","pubmedId":"8621424"}
