All tissues were positively stained for FGFR-1. Primary brain tumors were more abundantly immunoreactive than normal brain tissues (Mann-Whitney U test, P \u003c 0.05). There was significant correlation between the expression level of basic fibroblast growth factor (basic FGF) and that of FGFR-1 in tissues of human glioma (Spearman\u0027s test, P \u003c 0.05). The expression level of FGFR-1 of tumor cells increased in correlation with that of endothelial cells in glioma tissues (Spearman\u0027s test, P \u003c 0.001). We previously reported that basic FGF is produced in more than 90% of human glioma and meningioma tissues. Together with these data, it is suggested that basic FGF is involved in autonomous cell growth and tumorigenesis of gliomas and meningiomas as an autocrine growth factor in vivo.","title":"Expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 in human glioma and meningioma tissues.","pubmedId":"8177381"}
