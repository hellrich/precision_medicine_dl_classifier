This study was to describe the perceptions about cervical cancer and factors related to cervical cancer screening among Korean American women.\nFocus group methods.\nFive themes emerged. First, knowledge about cervical cancer; misconceptions about cervical cancer, its causes, reproductive anatomy and the treatment. Second, perceived meanings of having cervical cancer; most of the women felt that cervical cancer represented a loss of femininity and existential value of womanhood. Third, knowledge about cervical cancer screening ; regular medical check-ups were necessary for early detection and prevention of cervical cancer. Fourth, experiences and perceived meanings of cervical cancer screening; the participants expressed their feelings; embarrassment, fear, shame and shyness. Fifth, practices of cervical cancer screening; various intervals in participating in cervical cancer screening. But they mentioned several deterrents, language, insurance, time constraint, embarrassment, fear of the screening results, misbelief about susceptibility, lack of health prevention behavior, and lack of information written in Korean.\nResults emphasize the critical need for culturally appropriate health education to encourage participation of Korean American women in cervical cancer screening.","title":"Cervical cancer screening in Korean American women: findings from focus group interviews.","pubmedId":"15502427"}
