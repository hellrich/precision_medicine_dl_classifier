The incidence of NA in the elderly, however, is extremely low. The present study describes a 72-year-old male with NA that presented with typical symptoms and radiological findings. The location and extension of the tumor was too lateral and inferior to be effectively resected by an endoscopic approach. Therefore, a combination of endoscopic and open approaches was considered. The tumor was completely resected using an image-guided endoscopic-assisted sublabial and buccolabial incision approach. The post-operative histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the diagnosis of NA. The present study demonstrated the occurrence of NA in the elderly, and highlighted the potential of an image-guided endoscopic-assisted sublabial and buccolabial incision approach for the treatment of NA in the elderly.","title":"Management of nasopharyngeal angiofibroma in a 72-year-old male through a sublabial and buccolabial incision approach: A case report and literature review.","pubmedId":"26622661"}
