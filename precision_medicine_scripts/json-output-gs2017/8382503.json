The treatment of choice for stage IIB and III tumors is radiotherapy alone. Although the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy has not been documented, several trials are evaluating the potential use of combined chemotherapy and irradiation in bulky or extensive lesions. In most patients, radiotherapy consists of a combination of external-beam irradiation of the pelvis and two intracavitary radioactive source insertions. This article reviews the basic principles of management of patients with cervical cancer and describes the radiotherapy techniques employed.","title":"Radiation therapy in the management of cancer of the cervix.","pubmedId":"8382503"}
