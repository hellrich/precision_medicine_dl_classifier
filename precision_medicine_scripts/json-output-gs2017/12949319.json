We describe a 1-year-old infant who had tooth loss and palmar hyperkeratosis as the primary manifestations of CIPA. He was initially evaluated by a pediatric dentist and epidermal dysplasia syndromes were considered, but insensitivity to pain was suspected after a skeletal survey revealed an unrecognized skull fracture. Nerve conduction studies were normal, as was his response to subdermal histamine injection. Sequence analysis of his NTRK1 gene revealed 2 mutations: 1 mutation is novel, while the other has been described previously in a patient of northern European descent. An antibody directed against NTRK1 revealed persistent expression in keratinocytes, consistent with the mutations in this patient. Skin biopsy specimens revealed a lack of epidermal and sweat gland innervation. Immunohistochemistry of skin biopsy specimens, together with routine nerve conduction studies, can provide quick and reliable confirmation if CIPA is clinically suspected.","title":"An infant with primary tooth loss and palmar hyperkeratosis: a novel mutation in the NTRK1 gene causing congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis.","pubmedId":"12949319"}
