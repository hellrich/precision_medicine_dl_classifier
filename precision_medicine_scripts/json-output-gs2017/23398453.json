We have discovered a novel class of small molecules that inhibit mutant B-Raf(V600E) kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo. Investigations into the structure-activity relationships of the series are presented along with efforts to improve upon the cellular potency, solubility, and pharmacokinetic profile. Compounds selectively inhibited B-Raf(V600E) in vitro and showed preferential antiproliferative activity in mutant B-Raf(V600E) cell lines and exhibited selectivity in a kinase panel against other kinases. Examples from this series inhibit growth of a B-Raf(V600E) A375 xenograft in vivo at a well-tolerated dose. In addition, aminoquinazolines described herein were shown to display pERK elevation in nonmutant B-Raf cell lines in vitro.","title":"Discovery and optimization of a novel series of potent mutant B-Raf(V600E) selective kinase inhibitors.","pubmedId":"23398453"}
