She presented with epigastric pain and weight loss, these symptoms developed 3 months before. Physical examination revealed mild pain on deep palpation of mesogastrium, without palpable abdominal mass; rest of the examination was normal. The laboratory data showed hemoglobin 13.3 gr/dl; WBC, platelets, blood coagulation test, blood biochemistry, electrolytes, liver function test were normals. Urine test: 14-16 leukocytes per field, urocultive negative, Ca 19.9: 21.2 (0-37). Her serology for hydatic cyst (arc V and inmunoblot) was negative.Abdominal ultrasound showed between body and tail of the pancreas a solid hypoechoic image. In abdominal CT was detected in the body of the pancreas the presence of two hypodense lesions with average density of 25 UH and mediate 50 and 22 mm in diameter. The nuclear magnetic resonance imaging identified the body of the pancreas, bilobed cyst of 45 and 25 mm in diameter, with isointensity in T1, hyperintensity in T2, unchanged after fat saturation, with peripheral contrast enhancement. Operation findings showed a cystic tumor in the body of pancreas without signs of infiltration to other organs. Therefore, distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were carried out. The tumor was 60 x 46 x 35 mm and a half oval, encapsulated, irregular consistency, which the court left necrotic-looking material flow. The study showed the pattern typical hyalinized perivascular pseudopapillary with stroma, in immunohistochemical studies positive immunoreactivity was observed in cyclin D1 and progesterone receptor, also were positive for vimentin, enolase neuronoespecífica and CD-56. The proliferation index assessed by Ki-67 was less than 1% in tumor cells. The solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas is a low-grade malignancy, relatively rare, representing between 0.9 and 2.7% of all pancreatic malignancies. It mainly affects young women (89% of cases), with a mean age at diagnosis of 28 years. Most have specific symptoms related to intra-abdominal mass and more than one third are usually discovered incidentally.","title":"[Frantz tumor: a pancreatic pseudopapillary solid neoplasia].","pubmedId":"21544157"}
