The ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion is often associated with small cell lung cancer. We report the case of 64-years-old man with persistent hypokalemia in Cushing\u0027s syndrome due to ectopic ACTH secretion. The patient was affected by small cell lung cancer and presented an hypothiroidism too. A proper chemotherapy resulted in remission of the hypokalemia, but the hypothiroidism was not influenced during our observation period.","title":"[Hypokalemia from ectopic ACTH secretion and hypothiroidism in patient affected by small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"19475841"}
