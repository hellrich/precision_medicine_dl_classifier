We have attempted to evaluate the relevance of changes in Membrane Fluidity (MF) and associated apoptotic cell death in cervical cancer cells after first fractionated dose of radiation therapy to treatment outcome of stage IIIB cervical carcinoma patients.\nBiopsies of 15 patients with histologically proven cervix cancer were collected from the patients before and 24 h after first fractionated radiation dose of 2 grays (Gy). Cell suspension made in Dulbecco\u0027s Modified Eagle\u0027s Medium (DMEM) were used for further investigations and cell suspension of cervix cancer patient were used to measure MF by fluorescence polarization method and apoptotic index (AI) was determined by Tdt dUTP Nucleotide End Labeling (TUNEL) assay.\nA substantial increase in MF and AI was observed in cervical cancer cells irradiated ex vivo . A significant correlation ( P P \u003e 0.1) was detected between changes in MF and treatment outcome of patients.\nPreliminary results showed significant change in MF and a marked increase in percentage apoptosis of cervix cancer cells irradiated ex vivo . The changes in AI after first fractionated dose of radiotherapy in cervical carcinoma patients may provide a predictor of prognosis for radiotherapy in uterine cervical carcinoma patients.","title":"Programmed cell death as a prognostic indicator for radiation therapy in cervical carcinoma patients: a pilot study.","pubmedId":"17998625"}
