Here we describe a case of retroperitoneal liposarcoma in a 61-year-old male. Preoperative computed tomography revealed an intraabdominal huge mass, and a clinical diagnosis of liposarcoma. Intraoperatively, the mass involved the right kidney and bladder, completely surrounding the right ureter. The tumor and the lower half ureter were removed. Successful reconstruction of a neoureter was performed with the Boari flap coupled with nephropexy and a psoas hitch. The detailed salient steps performed in this case are reported, together with a review of the literature.","title":"[Retroperitoneal liposarcoma surgically repaired with Boari flap].","pubmedId":"19227206"}
