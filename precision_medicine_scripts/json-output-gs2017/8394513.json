In the floor of the navel a granulomatoid lesion was observed, which histopathologically proved to be a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. This was thought to be a primary tumour as extensive investigation revealed no other primary tumour. The umbilical area was excised. Colonic malrotation was seen as well as a Meckel\u0027s diverticulum. The patient recovered completely.","title":"[Primary adenocarcinoma of the navel after a seemingly harmless discharge of many years\u0027 duration].","pubmedId":"8394513"}
