Two histomorphologically representative areas were identified and arrayed on a tissue microarray. Immunohistochemistry staining were performed using antibodies to detect the expression of c-kit protein (CD117), CD34, smooth muscle actin, desmin, S-100, Ki-67, P53 and bcl-2 protein. The relationship between clinicopathologic features and prognosis was analyzed by univariate analysis.\nThe 1-, 3-, 5-year survival rate of 58 such patients were 98.3%, 69.7%, and 50.9% respectively. The prognosis was related with tumor size and gender by univariate analysis (P\u003c 0.05).\nMore attention should be paid to the male patients with small intestine stromal tumors,especially those with tumors size\u003e 5 cm, because those tumors are more likely to metastasize than smaller tumors (\u003c or \u003d 5 cm).","title":"[Analysis of prognostic factors in gastrointestinal stromal tumors of the small intestine].","pubmedId":"16167230"}
