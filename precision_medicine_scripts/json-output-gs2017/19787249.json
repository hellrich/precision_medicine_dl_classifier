We constructed retroviral expression libraries for the human ovarian cancer cell lines SHIN-3 and TYK-CPr, and performed a focus formation assay with 3T3 cells. As a result, proteasome subunit beta-type 2 (PSMB2), ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14), and keratin 8 (KRT8) were identified from SHIN-3, and polymerase II RNA subunit (POLR2E), chaperonin containing T-complex polypeptide 1 subunit 4 (CCT4), glia maturation factor beta (GMFB), and neuroblastoma ras viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) from TYK-CPr. NRAS gene analysis revealed a CAA --\u003e AAA substitution at codon 61, resulting in a Glu --\u003e Lys change at position 61. When the mutant NRAS was introduced into fibroblasts for its expression, many transformed foci were generated, confirming the transforming ability of the mutant NRAS.","title":"Screening for genetic abnormalities involved in ovarian carcinogenesis using retroviral expression libraries.","pubmedId":"19787249"}
