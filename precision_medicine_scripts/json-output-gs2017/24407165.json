In particular, for patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma and CNS metastases, much remains unknown about the safety and efficacy of the novel BRAF-targeted agents when administered in close sequence with radiation. We report two cases of rapid development of CNS radiation necrosis in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with the BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, closely sequenced with stereotactic radiosurgery or fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy. In the absence of prospective safety data from clinical trials, we advise vigilance in monitoring patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma whose treatment plan includes CNS radiation and vemurafenib and caution when assessing treatment response within the CNS in these patients.
