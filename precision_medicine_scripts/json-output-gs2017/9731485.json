We detected LOH in 10 of 19 (52.6%) informative colorectal cancers at loci D19S886 and/or D19S883, but no LOH was observed in 25 informative adenomas. We detected a total of 9 somatic mutations [7 of 13 (53.8%) left-sided colon cancers and 2 of 7 (28.6%) left-sided adenomas with high-grade dysplasia], but no mutations were detected in right-sided colon tumors. Of the nine mutations, one was a frameshift mutation (the same mutation detected in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome family previously), and the other eight were missense mutations. This results indicate that STK11 is a tumor suppressor gene and that genetic changes of STK11 play an important role in left-sided colon cancer carcinogenesis.","title":"Frequent somatic mutations in serine/threonine kinase 11/Peutz-Jeghers syndrome gene in left-sided colon cancer.","pubmedId":"9731485"}
