For advanced gastric cancer, a multidisciplinary approach has been attempted to improve patient prognosis. Potentially resectable and curable advanced gastric cancer is treated with routine surgery, followed by postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. For highly advanced gastric cancer, extended radical surgery or preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy have been attempted. Laparoscopic gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer has not been widely used because of the difficult surgical technique involved, but enhanced magnification in the surgical field is expected to improve the accuracy of the lymph node dissection procedure. In future, the significance of currently available treatments should be investigated. The key treatment for advanced gastric cancer at present is surgery.","title":"[Current state of treatment for advanced gastric cancer].","pubmedId":"21368481"}
