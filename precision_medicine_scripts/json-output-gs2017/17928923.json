In this study, the eukaryotic expression vectors pBP-wt-PTEN (containing a wild-type PTEN gene) and pBP-G129R-PTEN (containing a mutant PTEN gene) were used to transfect breast cancer ZR-75-1 cells. After transfection, ZR-75-1 cells expressing PTEN were obtained and tested. The blue exclusion assay showed the growth rate of the cells transfected with pBP-wt-PTEN was significantly lower than that of the control cells transfected with pBP-G129R-PTEN. Analysis of the cell cycle by flow cytometry showed that the progression from the G(1) to the S phase was arrested in cells expressing wild-type PTEN. Some typical morphological changes of apoptosis were also observed in cells transfected with pBP-wt-PTEN, but not in those transfected with pBP-G129R-PTEN. This study shows that overexpression of PTEN in ZR-75-1 cells leads to cell growth arrest and apoptosis.","title":"Overexpression of PTEN induces cell growth arrest and apoptosis in human breast cancer ZR-75-1 cells.","pubmedId":"17928923"}
