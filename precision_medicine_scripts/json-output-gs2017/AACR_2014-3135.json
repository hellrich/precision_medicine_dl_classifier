While combined BRAF and EGFR inhibition has shown some success in early clinical trials, there are still a subset of patients who do not respond to this combination. The purpose of this study is to identify which BRAFV600E tumors would be expected to respond to combined BRAF/EGFR inhibition based on the pre-treatment levels of pEGFR.A genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) for Apc-/- BrafV600E/+ p53-/- CRC was used for the study. Tumors were induced in the colons using adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase. Tumors were visualized by optical colonoscopy and pre-treatment tissue biopsy samples were obtained. BRAF mutant mice were randomized to a combination treatment with a BRAF inhibitor (Dabrafenib), combined with either an EGFR inhibitor (Erlotinib) or a MEK inhibitor (Trametinib). Tumor growth or regression was followed for 21 days by colonoscopy.A retrospective analysis indicated that those tumors with high pre-treatment phosphorylated EGFR (p-EGFR) levels had significant responses to combined BRAF/EGFR therapy, while those tumors with little to no response to combined BRAF/EGFR therapy had low levels of p-EGFR prior to treatment. Furthermore, the majority of tumors that had a significant response to the combined BRAF/MEK therapy had the lowest levels of pre-treatment p-EGFR.These pre-clinical data suggest that BRAFV600E CRC patients could benefit from being stratified by p-EGFR levels prior to treatment. Those patients with high p-EGFR levels would be expected to respond best to combined BRAF/EGFR treatment, while those patients with low p-EGFR levels might benefit from a different combination therapy, such as combined BRAF/MEK inhibition.","title":"Pre-treatment p-EGFR levels in tumors from a genetically engineered mouse model of BRAFV600E colorectal cancer predict response to combined BRAF/EGFR inhibition","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-3135"}
