The BRCA2 protein directly associates with Rad51, that is essential for repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination (HR). In this report, we study the BRCA2-defective Chinese hamster cell mutant V-C8 for its ability to perform homology-directed repair (HDR) between repeated sequences. V-C8 cells were recently shown to be defective in Rad51 foci formation in response to DNA damage. Strikingly, we find that these BRCA2 mutant cells exhibit a strong stimulation of HDR activity compared to the V79 parental cells, which harbor a wild-type BRCA2. Furthermore, molecular characterization of the HDR products shows that loss of BRCA2 in V-C8 cells leads to significant reduction in Rad51-dependent gene conversion but strong enhancement of Rad51-independent single-strand annealing (SSA) events frequency. These data imply that, when HDR by conservative gene conversion is impaired, DSBs usually repaired by this pathway are instead resolved by other non-conservative HDR subpathways. Therefore, high chromosomal instability in BRCA2-deficient cells presumably results from enhancement of error-prone repair mechanisms, such as SSA.","title":"Deficiency in BRCA2 leads to increase in non-conservative homologous recombination.","pubmedId":"12140769"}
