It generally presents beyond the fifth decade of life and usually is a BRAF wild-type melanoma.\nTo report the first cases of multiple primary AM in Caucasians.\nClinical, dermoscopic, pathological and molecular profiles.\nA healthy 34- year-old male presented an in situ subungual melanoma on his finger, and 22 months later a fast-growing nodular melanoma appeared in an existing nevus on the sole. Both melanomas carried the V600E BRAF mutation. A 19-year-old female patient presented 2 in situ melanomas on different parts of her left foot within a 6-year period of time. The patients have neither familiar melanoma nor germline mutations in CDKN2A/CDK4 genes.\nMultiple AM in Caucasians is very rare. BRAF mutations are possible, especially in a high-risk set of patients with multiple nevi. Specific acral examination must be recommended since AM still suffers delayed detection.","title":"Multiple primary acral melanomas in two young caucasian patients.","pubmedId":"24942556"}
