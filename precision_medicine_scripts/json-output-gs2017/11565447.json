All subjects were interviewed and tested for hepatitis B and C infection. For all six cholangiocarcinomas, 97 hepatocellular carcinomas and 129 controls, sex steroids were determined in the blood.\nHepatitis B or C viruses, tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking and diabetes mellitus were not related to cholangiocarcinoma, but history of thyroid disease was. Estradiol levels were higher among cholangiocarcinoma cases than among the other two groups.\nThis study provides evidence that endocrine and autoimmune factors are important in the etiology of cholangiocarcinoma.","title":"Risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma in a low risk Caucasian population.","pubmedId":"11565447"}
