A 75-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with blurred vision and exophthalmos in the left eye. Left lower hemianopsia, deterioration of visual acuity and right cerebellar signs were found on neurological examination. CT and MR image revealed an intraosseous tumor of the left sphenoid bone and a right tentorial mass. Cytogenetic analysis failed to reveal any abnormalities of chromosome 22. The intraosseous tumor which was transitional type meningioma and the tentorial mass, which was a fibroblastic meningioma were successfully excised. Postoperatively, the patient\u0027s symptoms and signs improved. Intraosseous meningioma associated with multiple meningioma is extremely rare and the histogenesis of meningioma arising from ectopic arachnoid cells is discussed.","title":"[Multiple meningioma associated with intraosseous and tentorial meningioma--case report].","pubmedId":"7999448"}
