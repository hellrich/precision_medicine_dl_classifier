Tumors occurring in patients with NF1 are primarily peripheral neurofibromas, while NF2 patients present with central schwannomas. Malignant transformation has been described in NF1 patients; however, in NF2 the risk of malignant transformation is extremely rare. In this case report, the authors document a retroperitoneal neurogenic sarcoma occurring in a 20-year-old woman with NF2 (bilateral acoustic schwannomas, meningioma, and multiple intraspinal tumors).","title":"Retroperitoneal neurofibrosarcoma in a patient with neurofibromatosis. 2: A case report and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"14692188"}
