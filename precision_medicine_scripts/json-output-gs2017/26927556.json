Ki-67 labeling index was introduced to determine the proliferation of glioma cells, and the microvessel density was measured through CD34 staining. Statistical analyses were performed to show the correlations of IDH1 mutation with cell proliferation and microvessel density.\nThe mutant rates of IDH1 were about 50%-60% in grade II-III gliomas and secondary glioblastomas, which were significantly higher than those in pilocytic astrocytoma (grade I) and primary glioblastoma (grade IV). Moreover, the level of IDH1 (R132H) protein was positively correlated with Ki-67 labeling index and microvessel density.\nIDH mutation was common in grade II-III glioma and secondary glioblastoma, and the mutant IDH1 (R132H) might play a critical role in the cell proliferation and angiogenesis of glioma.","title":"[The expression of IDH1 (R132H) is positively correlated with cell proliferation and angiogenesis in glioma samples].","pubmedId":"26927556"}
