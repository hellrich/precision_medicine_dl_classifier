The aim of this study was to quantify how, in 1999. French practitioners applied recommendations on hypertension (HTN), diabetes and hypercholesterolemia in recently diagnosed hypertensive patients and to evaluate whether or not the recommended targets were met. 1639 French GPs and cardiologists included 5831 recently diagnosed (7.5 +/- 3.6 months) hypertensives (57 +/- 12 years of age, M/F \u003d 55/45%). Initial BP was 173 +/- 15/99 +/- 9 mmHg. 56% had no concomitant disease, 36% had either diabetes, dyslipidemia or coronary heart disease, 8% had at least two concomitant diseases. At the time of the study corresponding to 6.3 +/- 3.8 months after initiation of diet and/or medical treatment, their BP was 148 +/- 17/86 +/- 11 mmHg (-25/-19 mmHg). At that time only 37% of patients with stage 2 HTN were encouraged to adopt lifestyle modifications without any medical treatment as recommended by the JNC VI. Among these hypertensives, measurement of plasma cholesterol was performed in only 61%, HDL-C/LDL-C in 26% and blood glucose in 51%. In the patients with dyslipidemia, LDL-C was measured in only 47%. In the 677 diabetic patients only 27% had a glycated hemoglobin measurement. The percentage of patients reaching target BP was 59% as regard DBP \u003c 90 mmHg, 25% as regard SBP \u003c 140 mmHg, and 23% reached both target values of BP. In addition, 30% of patients with dyslipidemia reached the target LDL-C as defined by French recommendations (ANAES 1996) and 30% of the diabetic patients reached the target value for glycemia recommended by ADA (1997). In 1999 in France, a minority of patients reaches the national or international recommended target values for blood pressure, glycemia and plasma LDL-cholesterol. In spite of that, French practitioners do not implement all the available diagnostic tools to improve the treatment of metabolic disorders in hypertensive patients. As a conclusion, to improve the prognosis of hypertensive patients, it is mandatory to raise the awareness of physicians about multiple risk factor management and help them implement the recommendations in their daily practice.","title":"[Differences between management guidelines and global health strategies for arterial hypertension with metabolic disorders in France in 1999.
