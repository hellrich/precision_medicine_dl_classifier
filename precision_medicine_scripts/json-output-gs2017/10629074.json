In the present study, we have examined the roles of H-ras and N-ras, members of the human ras gene family, in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. We show that H-ras, but not N-ras, induces an invasive phenotype in human breast epithelial cells (MCF10A) as determined by the Matrigel invasion assay, whereas both H-ras and N-ras induce anchorage-independent growth, as shown by soft agar assay. We examined the effects of H-ras and N-ras activation on the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, which can degrade type IV collagen, the major structural collagen of the basement membrane. We show that MMP-2 is efficiently induced by H-ras, whereas MMP-9 induction is more prominent in N-ras-activated MCF10A cells. We also show that H-ras-mediated invasiveness is significantly inhibited when the expression of MMP-2 is down-regulated, using an oligodeoxyribonucleotide complementary to the MMP-2 mRNA, or when MMP-2 activity is blocked by its inhibitor TIMP-2 (tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase-2). Our results show that the H-ras-induced invasive phenotype is associated more closely with the expression of MMP-2 in human breast epithelial cells, rather than the induction of MMP-9 expression, as shown previously for rat embryonic fibroblasts.","title":"H-ras, but not N-ras, induces an invasive phenotype in human breast epithelial cells: a role for MMP-2 in the H-ras-induced invasive phenotype.","pubmedId":"10629074"}
