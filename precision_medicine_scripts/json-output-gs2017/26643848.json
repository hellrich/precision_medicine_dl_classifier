Clinical and pathological associations of these mutations were investigated in a cohort of 1119 patients with known BRAF mutation status. A BRAF mutation was identified in 435 patients; Mutations at L597 and the K601E mutation were seen in 3.4 and 3.2% of these, respectively. K601E melanomas tended to occur in male patients, a median age of 58 yr, were generally found on the trunk (64%) and uncommonly associated with chronically sun-damaged (CSD) skin. BRAF L597 melanomas occurred in older patients (median 66 yr), but were associated with CSD skin (extremities or head and neck location - 73.3%, P \u003d 0.001). Twenty-three percent of patients with V600E- and 43% of patients with K601E-mutant melanomas presented with nodal disease at diagnosis compared to just 14% of patients with BRAF wild-type tumors (P \u003d 0.001 and 0.006, respectively). Overall, these mutations represent a significant minority of BRAF mutations, but have distinct clinicopathological phenotypes and clinical behaviors.","title":"Clinicopathological characteristics associated with BRAF(K601E) and BRAF(L597) mutations in melanoma.","pubmedId":"26643848"}
