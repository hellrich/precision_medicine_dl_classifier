This study aimed to identify clinicopathologic features of ampullary carcinoma with lymph node metastases.\nThe records of 74 consecutive patients with ampullary adenocarcinoma who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) with regional lymph node dissection were retrospectively analyzed.\nTwenty-two patients (30%) with lymph node metastasis had significantly worse survival after resection than those without lymph node metastasis (p \u003d 0.017). Univariate analyses revealed that preoperative biliary drainage; elevated serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (â‰¥36 U/ml); moderate-to-poor pathologic grade (G2/3); perineural, vascular, lymphatic, pancreas, and duodenal invasion; and T category were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis. In multivariate analysis, only pathologic grade (G2/3) remained significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (hazard ratio, 6.51; p \u003d 0.035). In sub-classified analysis for T category, lymph node metastasis was found in 5 of 22 cases (22.7%) of T1 tumors. Four of five cases with lymph node metastases had a dominant G2/3 component, whereas only 2 of 17 cases without lymph node metastases had a G2/3 component in T1 tumors (p \u003d 0.0036).\nPathologic grade (G2/3) was significantly and independently associated with lymph node metastasis and was also a significant predictor in T1 tumor cases.","title":"Factors influencing lymph node metastasis in patients with ampullary adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"25613423"}
