A total of 48 female pigs [DurocÃ—Large White/Landrace (A; n\u003d24) and Large White/Landrace (B; n\u003d24)] were randomly allocated immediately prior to slaughter to one of two low voltage stimulation treatments; no stimulation or 150 mA applied for 30 s at 2 min post-exsanguination. Each side of the carcass was then randomly allocated to an ageing treatment of either 2 or 7 days post-slaughter. Muscle pH of the M. longissimus lumborum was lower (P\u003c0.001) in electrically stimulated carcasses when measured from 40 min to 8 h post-slaughter compared with non-stimulated carcasses. Percentage drip loss, muscle lightness and PSE incidence were not influenced (P\u003e0.05) by electrical stimulation. Electrical stimulation of pig carcasses and ageing pork for 7 days post-slaughter both improved (P\u003c0.001) consumer scores for tenderness, juiciness, overall liking and quality category, however the interaction term of electrical stimulation and ageing was not significant for any of the sensory attributes. Pork from non-stimulated carcasses that was aged for 2 day post-slaughter was less tender (P\u003c0.01) compared with pork in all other treatments. These results indicate that electrical stimulation (150 mA applied for 30 sec at 2 min post-exsanguination) was effective in improving eating quality attributes of pork, particularly when pork was aged for only 2 days post-slaughter, without detrimentally affecting colour or drip loss.","title":"Effect of low voltage electrical stimulation of pig carcasses and ageing on sensory attributes of fresh pork.","pubmedId":"22063775"}
