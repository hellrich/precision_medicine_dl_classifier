Large scale screening systems for these rare populations are necessary for the development of molecular targeted therapies. Thus, a nationwide lung cancer genomic screening project in Japan (LC-SCRUM-Japan) has been operated since February 2013. Methods: Non-squamous NSCLCs without EGFR mutations were eligible for inclusion in this study. The tumors were analyzed for ALK/RET/ROS1 fusions using RT-PCR, and detected fusions were confirmed by FISH. Since March 2015, this nationwide project has been amended to an academic-industrial collaboration project with 14 pharmaceutical companies, and the samples were further subjected to a next-generation sequencing (NGS) system, Oncomine Comprehensive Assay, enabling the simultaneous analysis of 143 cancer-related genes. Results: As of December 31, 2015, 195 institutions across Japan were participating and 2161 patients had been enrolled. Among 1988 available samples, including 497 for the NGS analysis, ALK/RET/ROS1 fusions were detected in 37 (2%)/51 (3%)/86 (4%), respectively. The NGS analysis also showed that 269 cases (54%) had targetable gene alterations, including 82 KRAS mutations (17%), 36 ERBB2 mutations (7%), 28 BRAF mutations (6%), 22 PIK3CA mutations (4%), 6 NRAS mutations (1%), 6 MAP2K1 mutations (1%) and 2 FGFR2 fusions (0.4%). MET/ERBB2/FGFR1 amplifications were also detected by the NGS in 13 (3%)/11 (2%)/3 (1%) cases, respectively. Through this screening, the preplanned numbers of patient with RET and ROS1 fusions (n \u003d 19 and 26, respectively) were successfully enrolled in clinical trials of vandetanib (LURET study in Japan) and of crizotinib (OO12-01 study in East Asia), respectively. Three patients with ERBB2 alterations and 2 with MET amplifications were also enrolled in genotype-matched ongoing trials. Conclusions: This nationwide screening system enables efficiently and successfully detecting various targetable gene alterations in NSCLC, thereby contributing to promote cancer precision medicine through the development of targeted therapies.","title":"Development of nationwide genomic screening project (LC-SCRUM-Japan) contributing to the establishment of precision medicine in Japan.","pubmedId":"ASCO_166878-176"}
