KRAS mutations are a negative prognostic factor for survival. Recent phase II trial with a MEK inhibitor has shown promising efficacy albeit at the cost of higher adverse events. Preclinical work by Moran et al showed that antifolate therapies like pemetrexed decrease KRAS gene expression in KRAS wild type and KRAS mutant but do not do so in KRAS mutant amplified cells. Targeted therapies for EGFR, ALK and ROS1 have increased the survival for lung adenocarcinoma expressing these actionable targets. No therapies are yet approved for KRAS mutant subsets. Hence therapeutic strategies that target this cohort represent an unmet medical need.   Methods:  We reviewed data from patients (pts) in our thoracic oncology clinic with stage IIIB and stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with KRAS mutation positive tumours who received pemetrexed either during induction or maintenance therapy. Pt characteristics including age, sex, race, smoking history, KRAS mutation subtype and overall survival were analyzed.  Results:  Between April 2010 and October 2012 we treated 154 pts with stage IIIB and stage IV lung adenocarcinoma. Of these 154 pts we found 34 patients with KRAS mutation positive tumours. 10 pts out of 34 pts with KRAS mutation positive tumours received pemetrexed during induction or maintenance therapy and were analyzed further. Median age 63. 60% females. 90% Caucasians. 90% were smokers. KRAS 12C mutation was found in 2 pts, KRAS 12V in 4, KRAS 12A in 3 and KRAS 13A in 1 pt. 4(40%) patients died. Median overall survival (OS) in the KRAS 12C, 12V, 12A and 13A was 14, 9.5, 10 and 12 months respectively.  Conclusions:  The median OS in published series is 15.4, 14, 8 and 7 months in the KRAS 12C, 12V, 12A and 13A cohorts respectively (Rosell et al). Our analysis found that pts with KRAS 12C, 12A and 13A mutation had a survival advantage with pemetrexed therapy as compared to pts with KRAS 12V mutation. Thus this retrospective study supports the concept that KRAS mutation status affects sensitivity to antifolate therapy (pemetrexed).","title":"KRAS gene mutation status and sensitivity to pemetrexed: A retrospective analysis.","pubmedId":"ASCO_110577-132"}
