To date there are no established treatment options for the refractory and recurrent disease and only a few prospective trials have been conducted in patients with TC. Here we present a case of a relapsed TC patient, who, by using combination chemotherapy, showed a positive response to sorafenib with C-KIT exon 11 mutation.","title":"Promising efficacy of sorafenib in a relapsed thymic carcinoma with C-KIT exon 11 deletion mutation.","pubmedId":"20970876"}
