We investigated the occurrence of BRAF exon 15 and KRAS codon 12 and 13 mutations in Moroccan patients with colorectal cancer.\nSixty-two samples from patients with sporadic colorectal adenocarcinomas were studied for BRAF exon 15 and KRAS codon 12 and 13 mutations. DNA from paraffin-embedded tissue specimens was analyzed by a combination of polymerase chain reaction-high resolution melting and direct sequencing.\nOf the analyzed specimens, 29% exhibited KRAS codon 12 or 13 mutations and only 1.6% carried a BRAF codon 600 mutation. KRAS mutations were more often observed in women (35.5%) than in men (22.6%). Patients in the age range between 41 and 60 years were more likely to be carriers of this mutation. No KRAS mutations were detected in patients aged \u003e60 years.\nDespite the limited study sample, our data suggest that KRAS mutations arise more frequently than BRAF mutations in Moroccan patients with colorectal carcinomas. The KRAS mutation status must be assessed in a large cohort of Moroccan patients to confirm these findings and to determine whether this mutation in combination with extrinsic, environmental or microenvironmental factors might be involved in the high frequency of colorectal cancer in middle-aged Moroccans.","title":"Mutation analysis of BRAF exon 15 and KRAS codons 12 and 13 in Moroccan patients with colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"21161938"}
