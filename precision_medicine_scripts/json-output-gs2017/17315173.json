Expression of HER-2/neu oncoprotein was assessed in archival tumor tissues from 87 untreated HNSCC patients by immunohistochemical technique. Data were correlated with both the clinicopathologic parameters and patient survival.\nA high membranous HER-2/neu protein expression level was found in 39% of patients. Multivariate analysis indicated that HER-2/neu protein expression and pN lymph-node status were independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival.\nHER2/neu overexpression and its relationship with survival suggest that new therapeutic approaches targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family receptors could provide a new way of treating HNSCC patients with HER2/neu-positive neoplastic lesions.","title":"Prognostic impact of HER-2/neu expression on squamous head and neck carcinomas.","pubmedId":"17315173"}
