The present study evaluates both routine cytology and Ki-ras mutational analysis in the detection of peritoneal micrometastases in 24 subjects with pancreatic adenocarcinoma compared to seven control cases of chronic pancreatitis and seven control cases of cholecystitis. Locoregional extension, vascular invasion, and distal metastases were confirmed in 21/24 (88%) of the subjects with pancreatic adenocarcinoma by compute tomography, angiography, endosonography, or laparoscopy. The most common site of histologically confirmed extrapancreatic involvement was the vasculature (29%), followed by the liver (25%), duodenum (17%), peritoneum (17%), and lymph nodes (12%). Peritoneal lavage cytology was positive in 3/24 (12%) cases of pancreatic carcinoma while Ki-ras codon 12 mutational analysis was positive in 2/24 (8%). Two histologically confirmed cases of peritoneal metastases were not detected by either methodology, while peritoneal lavage cytology detected malignant cells in one case with histologically confirmed lymph node metastasis.","title":"Peritoneal exfoliative cytology and Ki-ras mutational analysis in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"7497464"}
