TP53 mutations were observed in 9 cases; APC mutations were identified in 3 cases; and ATM and STK11 were mutated in 2 cases. Seven HG-IEN lesions shared an identical mutational profile with the EGC from the same patient; 13 mutations observed in APC, ATM, FGFR3, PIK3CA, RB1, STK11, and TP53 genes were shared by both HG-IEN and ECG lesions. CDKN2A, IDH2, MET, and RET mutations were observed only in EGC. TP53 deregulation was further investigated in an independent series of 75 biopsies corresponding to all the phenotypic lesions occurring in the EGC carcinogenetic cascade. p53 nuclear immunoreaction progressively increased along with the dedifferentiation of the lesions (P \u003c 0.001). Overall, 18 of 20 p53-positive lesions showed a TP53 mutated gene.\nOur results support the molecular similarity between HG-IEN and EGC and suggest a relevant role for TP53 in the progression to the invasive phenotype and the use of immunohistochemistry as a surrogate to detect TP53 gene mutations.","title":"High-throughput mutation profiling identifies novel molecular dysregulation in high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and early gastric cancers.","pubmedId":"24272205"}
