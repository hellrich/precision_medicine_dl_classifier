Data on VTEs and ATEs were extracted.\nA total of 8,410 patients from 12 trials were included for analysis. Anti-EGFR agents significantly increased the risk of all-grade and high-grade VTEs (Peto OR 1.50, 95%CI 1.16-1.95, P \u003d 0.002; Peto OR 1.73, 95%CI: 1.32-2.26, p \u003c 0.001, respectively), but not for all-grade and high-grade ATEs.\nThe use of anti-EGFR agents significantly increased the risk of all-grade and high-grade VTEs but not for ATEs in NSCLC patients.","title":"Meta-analysis of the incidence and risk of arterial and venous thromboembolic events associated with anti-EGFR agents in non-small-cell lung cancer patients.","pubmedId":"27494194"}
