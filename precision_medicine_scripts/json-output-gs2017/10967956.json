From the past medical history, only an autoimmune hypothyroidism was known. On initial, examination leading features were carpopedal spasms and a pulse deficit. Her general condition, especially the nutritional status was low.\nSerum levels of potassium (2.2 mmol/l) and calcium (1.45 mmol/l) were low, as well as the levels of total protein (5.1 g/dl) and albumin (2.94 g/dl). Clotting time was prolonged (Quick 51%). The ECG showed a ventricular bigeminus and a prolonged QT-period (120% rel). Endoscopy and biopsy showed a total villous atrophy suggesting celiac disease as probable cause. This was emphasized by the high antibody levels against gliadin (1:80) and endomyosin (1:40). Furthermore, the Human Leukocyte Antigen molecules HLA-B8 and HLA-DR3 showed increased expression.\nAfter normalizing the electrolyte imbalance intravenously the neurological symptoms disappeared as well as the arrhythmia. The QT-period went back to normal. Under initial drip feeding and a strict gluten-free diet the general condition improved quickly and the diarrhea stopped. A follow-up investigation 3 months later showed the woman in a good condition having gained 10 kg weight and an improvement in histological findings, so that diagnosis of celiac disease could be proved.\nThe possibility of ventricular arrhythmia and a prolonged QT-period in the ECG should be taken into account for patients diagnosed with celiac disease, especially in case of electrolyte imbalance. In these cases addition to a strict gluten free diet a rapid correction of the electrolyte imbalance is necessary because of the risk of sudden cardiac death. Furthermore associated disorders like autoimmune diseases expressing the same HLA-antigens (HLA-B8 and HLA-DR3) must be considered. Combined incidence of celiac disease and autoimmune hypothyroidism is well documented. For patients with celiac disease we therefore recommend a routine testing of thyroid hormone levels.","title":"[First diagnosis of celiac disease in a 67-year old female patient].","pubmedId":"10967956"}
