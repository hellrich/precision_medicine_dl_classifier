The purpose of the present study was to determine whether increased expression of OLC1 is associated with colorectal cancer.\nOLC1 expression was assayed in 150 colorectal cancer tissues by immunohistochemical staining (IHC). Multivariate and univariate analyses were performed to determine the association between OLC1 expression and prognosis.\nImmunohistochemical results revealed that 107 out of 150 colorectal cancer patients had increased levels of OLC1. OLC1 expression was significantly correlated with UICC stage (p\u003c0.001) and histological differentiation (p\u003c0.001) in colorectal cancer patients. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates in patients with strong-positive and weak OLC1 staining were 16.6% and 95.3%, respectively (p\u003c0.0001).\nOLC1 overexpression is an important factor in colorectal carcinoma prognosis and can be an interesting potential novel biomarker for colorectal cancer.","title":"Over-expression of the overexpressed in lung cancer-1 is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"24403489"}
