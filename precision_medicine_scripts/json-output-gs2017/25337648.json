The overall 5-year survival rates between 0.4 and 4%. Surgical resection is an option for only 10% of the patients with pancreatic cancer. Local recurrence and hepatic metastases occur within 2 years after surgery. There are currently several molecular pathways investigated and novel targeted treatments are on the market. However; the nature of pancreatic cancer with its ability to spread locally in the primary site and lymph nodes indicates that further experimentation with local interventional therapies could be a future treatment proposal as palliative care or adjunct to gene therapy and chemotherapy/radiotherapy. In the current review, we will summarize the molecular pathways and present the interventional treatment options for pancreatic cancer.
