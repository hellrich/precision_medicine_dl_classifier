Methods: Clinical data were collected from 88 consecutive patients with metastatic or unresectable GISTs treated with sunitinib from Nov 2005 to Jun 2009 at Asan Medical Center in Korea. Genotypes of the primary tumors were determined in 74 patients. Results: Sunitinib was administered either in intermittent (50 mg/day, 4 weeks on and 2 weeks off, n\u003d74) or continuous schedule (37.5 mg/day, n\u003d14). Patients started sunitinib therapy mostly (98%) because of progression after median 31.1 mo (1.8 - 83.2 mo) of the first line imatinib therapy. Treatment with sunitinib induced partial response (PR) in nine (10.2%), stable disease (SD) in 61 (69.3%) and progressive disease in 18 patients (20.5%). Clinical benefit rate (CBR, percentage of patients with complete response, PR, or SD  24 weeks) was 52.3%. With a median follow-up of 20.5 mo in surviving patients, the median time-to-progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) were 7.1 mo and 17.6 mo, respectively. Out of 74 who were tested for KIT (exon 9, 11, 13, 17) and PDGFRA (exon 12, 18) mutations, there was no mutation in 10 patients (13.5%), KIT exon 11 mutation in 47 (63.5%), KIT exon 9 mutation in 11 (14.9%), and PDGFRA mutation in 6 including 5 in exon 18. Patients with KIT exon 9 mutant GIST tended to have better CBR (63.6% vs. 46.8%, p\u003d0.504) and median TTP (13.6 mo vs. 6.9 mo, p\u003d0.631) than those with KIT exon 11 mutant GIST. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia of G  3 were observed in 30 (34.1%) and 29 (33.0%) patients, respectively. The most common G 3 or 4 non- hematologic adverse events (AEs) were hand-foot skin reaction (n\u003d22, 25.0%) and fatigue (n\u003d13, 14.8%). Dose reduction was required in 55 (62.5%) patients and eight discontinued treatment due to AEs or intolerance to sunitinib. Conclusions: Sunitinib was active and safe as the second line therapy for Korean patients with advanced GIST. Compared to Western experience, superior efficacy in KIT exon 9 mutant GISTs appears to be similar but less significant in Korean patients.","title":"Sunitinib as the second-line therapy for advanced GISTs after failure of imatinib in Korean patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_49470-74"}
