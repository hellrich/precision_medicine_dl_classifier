A recommendation for treatment was made if disease progression was indicated by unfavorable followup needle biopsy findings (Gleason pattern 4 or 5, greater than 2 biopsy cores with cancer, greater than 50% involvement of any core with cancer). Curable disease was defined on pathological examination of radical prostatectomy specimens as 1) organ confined cancer of Gleason score 7 or less, 2) cancer with extraprostatic extension of Gleason score 7 (3+4) or less with negative margins, seminal vesicles and lymph nodes, or 3) cancer of Gleason score 6 or less regardless of margin status or extraprostatic extension if negative seminal vesicles and lymph nodes.\nOf the 81 men 25 (31%) had progression of disease at followup. PSA density was statistically significantly higher (p \u003d 0.01) and the percentage of free PSA was statistically significantly lower (p \u003d 0.04) in men with compared to those without disease progression. Disease progression occurred in 22 of 39 men (56%) with every followup biopsy showing cancer compared to 3 of 42 (2%) men with 1 or more negative followup biopsies (p \u003c0.001). Of the 25 men with progression 13 underwent radical prostatectomy and 12 of 13 (92%) had curable cancers.\nExpectant management with curative intent may be a reasonable alternative for carefully selected older men who are thought to have small volume cancers.","title":"Expectant management of nonpalpable prostate cancer with curative intent: preliminary results.","pubmedId":"11832703"}
