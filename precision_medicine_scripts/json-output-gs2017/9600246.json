Women with CS are felt to have an increased risk of developing breast cancer, and virtually all women with CS develop bilateral fibrocystic disease of the breast. Recently, a series of germline mutations have been identified from CS families in a gene known as PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1. In this study, we used heteroduplex analysis and direct sequencing analysis and identified three novel germline mutations in the PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1 coding sequence from unrelated individuals with CS. We report a de novo transition (T--\u003eC) at nucleotide 335 in exon 5. This missense mutation resulted in a leucine to proline (CTA to CCA) change at codon 112. We also describe a novel splice site mutation (801+2T--\u003eG) in intron 7 that caused exon skipping in PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1 mRNA. The third mutation we report is a missense mutation, consisting of a transition (T--\u003eC) at nucleotide 202 in exon 3, resulting in a tyrosine to histidine (TAC to CAC) change at codon 68. Finally, we also detected a rare polymorphism in exon 7 of the PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1 coding sequence. These data confirm the observation that mutations of the PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1 coding sequence are responsible for at least some cases of CS, and further define the spectrum of mutations in this autosomal dominant disorder.","title":"The genetic basis of Cowden\u0027s syndrome: three novel mutations in PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1.","pubmedId":"9600246"}
