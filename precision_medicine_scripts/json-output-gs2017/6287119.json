Twelve tumors (15%) originated from bronchi. 24 (30%) were associated with scars, and 45 (55%) were not associated with either bronchus or scar (non-scar). Scar carcinomas differed significantly in cell type from bronchogenic and non-scar tumors in that 21 (88%) scar carcinomas were either adenocarcinomas or bronchioloalveolar carcinomas (p less than 0.001). Origin (bronchogenic, scar, non-scar) independent of cell type and tumor stage did not significantly influence survival. Stage of disease independent of cell type or origin affected survival (p less than 0.0001), as did cell type independent of tumor stage or origin (p less than 0.0001). Stage I disease and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma were associated with longer survival, while Stage II or III disease, small cell anaplastic carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma were associated with reduced survival. We conclude that associated scar influences cell type of peripheral lung carcinoma but does not influence patient survival, even among patients with similar cell type and stage of disease.","title":"Prognosis of pulmonary scar carcinoma.","pubmedId":"6287119"}
