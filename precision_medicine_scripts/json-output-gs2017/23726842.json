Although B-Raf(V600E) induces increased Mps1 protein contributing to centrosome amplification and chromosome instability, the regulatory mechanisms of Mps1 in melanoma cells is not fully understood. Here, we report that Mps1/AKT and B-Raf(WT)/ERK signaling form an auto-regulatory negative feedback loop in melanoma cells; notably, oncogenic B-Raf(V600E) abrogates the negative feedback loop, contributing the aberrant Mps1 functions and tumorigenesis. Our findings raise the possibility that targeting the oncogenic B-Raf and Mps1, especially when used in combination could potentially provide great therapeutic opportunities for cancer treatment.
