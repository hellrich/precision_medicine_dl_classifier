Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the association between PTEN loss, PIK3CA mutation and the efficacy of trastuzumab-based treatment in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.\nA computerized search was performed through the PubMed database, the online proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meetings, the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium and the International St. Gallen Breast Cancer Conference. Ten eligible studies including 1889 cases were identified.\nIn HER2-positive locally advanced breast cancer patients, neither PTEN loss, PIK3CA mutation nor PI3K activation was associated with the response rate of trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant treatment (PTEN loss: RR \u003d 0.687, 95% CI: 0.439-1.074, P \u003d 0.099; PIK3CA mutation: RR \u003d 1.114, 95% CI: 0.453-2.735, P \u003d 0.814; PI3K activation: RR \u003d 0.787, 95% CI: 0.417-1.484, P \u003d 0.459; RR \u003d 0.772, 95% CI: 0.387-1.539, P \u003d 0.462). In HER2-positive early stage breast cancer patients, PTEN loss was not associated with the disease-free survival (DFS) rate of trastuzumab-based adjuvant treatment (HR \u003d 1.096, 95% CI: 0.706-1.700, P \u003d 0.684). In HER2-positive recurrent or metastatic breast cancer patients, PTEN loss was significantly correlated with poorer efficacy of trastuzumab-based salvage treatment (RRâ€‰\u003d 0.682, 95% CI: 0.550-0.846, P \u003d 0.000).\nIn HER2-positive recurrent or metastatic breast cancer patients PTEN loss might indicate resistance to trastuzumab-based salvage treatment. Due to the small sample size and the considerable heterogeneity in the chemotherapy treatment regimens, further research is needed to clarify the association between PTEN loss, PIK3CA mutation and the efficacy of trastuzumab-based treatment in neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings.","title":"The predictive role of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss, phosphoinositol-3 (PI3) kinase (PIK3CA) mutation, and PI3K pathway activation in sensitivity to trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer: a meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"23574264"}
