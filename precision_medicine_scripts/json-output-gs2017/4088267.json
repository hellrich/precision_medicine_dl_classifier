Pancreatic duct drainage is a procedure of choice in chronic pancreatitis with an extent dilatation of the pancreatic duct, and resection of the pancreas must be limited in a few indicative patients. Late operative results of pancreatic cancer which has an invasion to the pancreatic capsule or lymphnode metastasis were poor. Tumors, even less than 2 cm in size have a high incidence of the vessel involvement. Even for the treatment of small pancreatic cancer, only combined modality treatment including systematic lymphnode dissection, chemotherapy and radiation therapy will provide improved late operative results.","title":"[Present status and some problems of pancreatic surgery].","pubmedId":"4088267"}
