We describe the clinicoradiological and histomorphological features of two such cases of meningioma, with a brief review of literature. One case in a 9-year-old girl, presented initially as an atypical meningioma in the right fronto-parietal region, which on recurrence 18 months later, evolved into a rhabdoid meningioma. The second case in a 33-year-old male was located in the right parieto-occipital region. ","title":"Rhabdoid meningioma: report of two cases.","pubmedId":"25859490"}
