The tumors arose as huge retroperitoneal masses in elderly patients, except for one that occurred in the spermatic cord. Three cases had local recurrences, and one of the seven patients who were followed up had died of the tumor. Grossly, the tumors were mostly confluent and multinodular and showed a glistening myxoid appearance in variable proportions, which merged gradually into or were juxtaposed to yellow fatty or sclerotic whitish areas. Microscopically, in addition to areas of well-differentiated lipoma-like or sclerosing liposarcoma, all the tumors contained myxoid portions characterized by scattered multinucleated or bizarre giant cells and a prominent plexiform vascular pattern that resembled myxoid MFH or myxofibrosarcoma. The myxoid areas were associated with discernible lipogenesis. High-grade dedifferentiation was present in one tumor. Cytogenetically, in one case, the myxoid lesion had nonrandom chromosomal aberrations, such as ring and marker chromosomes, characteristic of a well-differentiated variant of liposarcoma. In a nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis using archival paraffin-embedded tissue, it was seen that none of the eight tumors with myxoid MFH-like features had TLS/FUS-CHOP fusion transcripts characteristic of myxoid and round cell liposarcomas. These clinicopathologic and molecular features suggest that the current myxoid tumors are more closely related to well-differentiated liposarcoma rather than to ordinary myxoid liposarcoma despite their unequivocal myxoid morphology. Missense point mutations of the p53 gene were detected in two (25%) cases by single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequence analyses. Immunohistochemical expressions of p53 and mdm2 were observed in 75% of the cases, in which immunoreactive tumor cells were seen more often in the myxoid MFH-like areas. Thus, altered p53 pathways, such as p53 gene mutation and mdm2-mediated inactivation of p53, may play a pathogenetic role in this form of tumor progression showing myxoid MFH-like morphology in liposarcoma, as has been suggested in dedifferentiated liposarcoma.","title":"Retroperitoneal liposarcoma with combined well-differentiated and myxoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma-like myxoid areas.","pubmedId":"10584701"}
