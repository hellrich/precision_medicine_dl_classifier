Preoperative computed tomographic scans and endoscopic examination revealed a spherical submucosal tumor (7.7 x 6.1 x 6 cm) in the posterior wall of the stomach less than 1cm away from the cardia, on the small curvature side.\nThe tumor, which endosonographically had a volume of 282 cm(3), was completely resected by a full-thickness laparoscopic wedge excision without discontinuous gastric resection. The whole procedure was performed using 4 working ports (one 12-mm and three 5-mm ports) and 1 camera port (12 mm). Because the resection margins were tumor free on frozen sections and the distance between the resection margin and cardia was wide enough not to compromise food passage, there was no need for total gastrectomy or upper discontinuous gastric resection. The patient was discharged on the fourth postoperative day after an uneventful clinical course.\nHistological examination revealed a malignant gastrointestinal stroma tumor of the stomach. The patient was therefore enrolled for Imatinib adjuvant therapy. Careful and long-term follow-up of 21 months showed no signs of local or distant tumor recurrence. However, further follow-up is needed to monitor for signs of possible recurrence or distant metastases.\nThe described technique prevented proximal gastric resection and a risk of anastomosis without compromising the food passage and radicality.","title":"Laparoscopic gastric tailoring for huge subcardial gastrointestinal stromal tumor.","pubmedId":"17931527"}
