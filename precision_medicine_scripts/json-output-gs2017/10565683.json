In the retroperitoneal WD-DD liposarcomas, the predominant phenotype is represented by the aberrant (overexpressed) mdm2+/p53+ wild-type profile. At the nonretroperitoneal site, the WD liposarcomas present a wider association of MDM2/P53 gene expression; i.e., mdm2+/p53+, mdm2+/p53-, mdm2-/p53+ and mdm2-/p53-, and TP53 mutations seem to correlate with the dedifferentiation process. A biochemical study of mdm2-p53 association in 11 tumor samples characterized by the presence of different mdm2 and p53 immunophenotypes was performed. Immunoprecipitation assays using a p53-specific antibody were performed on tumor tissue and surrounding normal tissue; the immunoprecipitated material was then investigated for the presence of p53 (control) and of coimmunoprecipitated mdm2. This biochemical analysis showed that, in mdm2+/p53+/wild-type retroperitoneal liposarcomas, a band corresponded to mdm2 protein in the cellular lysates immunoprecipitated with a p53-directed antibody. In contrast, the mdm2+/p53- liposarcoma did not evidence the presence of mdm2 protein nor was p53 protein available to direct immunoprecipitation, as in the p53 mutant tumor samples with mdm2-/p53+ and mdm2-/p53- phenotypes. From the normal counterpart of retroperitoneal liposarcoma lysates, no p53 protein was immunoprecipitated. The findings in this study agree with the molecular data and they show the physical association of mdm2 and p53 in fresh liposarcoma surgical specimens.","title":"Biochemical uncovering of mdm2/p53 complexes in liposarcomas parallels their immunohistochemical detection.","pubmedId":"10565683"}
