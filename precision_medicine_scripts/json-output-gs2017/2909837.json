One family with multiple polyposis of the colon was excluded from the study. A history of colorectal cancer in one or more first-degree relatives was associated with a relative risk of colorectal cancer of 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 0.8 to 8.0), of adenoma of 2.0 (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 8.0) and of any colorectal neoplasm of 2.3 (95% confidence interval, 0.9 to 5.6). Four patients with colorectal cancer and one patient with colorectal adenoma had more than one first-degree relative with colorectal cancer, whereas no control subject gave this history. The five families that were represented by these cases each showed some other features of non-polyposis familial colorectal cancer. It was estimated that familial factors could explain 60% of colorectal cancer in persons with a family history of the disease in a first-degree relative and 5% of colorectal cancer in the population as a whole. Haemoccult II tests were posted to 629 living first-degree relatives of the patients with colorectal cancers and adenomas; 44% of these relatives returned the completed tests. Four relatives with positive results of tests both before and after dietary restriction were investigated; all four subjects had colorectal adenomas. In addition, one subject had a short segment of ulcerative colitis. A further mailing of Haemoccult II tests one year later gave a 39% response rate; no further cases of colorectal neoplasia were found. One relative developed carcinoma of the caecum 10 months after a negative result in the first round of Haemoccult screening. Persons with two or more first-degree relatives with colorectal cancer, with or without other features of non-polyposis familial colorectal cancer, are at a high risk of the development of colorectal cancer. The comparatively-poor response to an offer of Haemoccult II testing and its known insensitivity and lack of specificity suggest that it is not a satisfactory method of screening these high-risk subjects.","title":"Familial colorectal cancer and the screening of family members.","pubmedId":"2909837"}
