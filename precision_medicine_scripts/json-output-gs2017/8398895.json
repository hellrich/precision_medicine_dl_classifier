We have investigated the effect of the TRK-T1 oncogene in PC12 cells, a model system for studying neuronal differentiation and the mechanism of action of NGF. Here, we report that, in PC12 cells, the TRK-T1 oncogene has a differentiating effect that resembles that of NGF and requires the phosphorylation of the oncoprotein. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that TRK-T1, as well as the original TRK oncogene, induces PC12 differentiation by mimicking the action of NGF bound to its receptor.","title":"Expression of TRK-T1 oncogene induces differentiation of PC12 cells.","pubmedId":"8398895"}
