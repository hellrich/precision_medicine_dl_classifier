Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) accounts for 75% of cervical cancer cases in the USA, while adenocarcinoma (AC) accounts for 25%. The incidence of SCC is decreasing in the USA, yet AC is increasing. Many differences exist between cervical SCC and AC including anatomic origin, risk factors, prognosis, dissemination, sites of recurrence, and rates of metastasis. Despite differences, current treatment algorithms do not distinguish between cervical SCC and AC. To date, prospective research directed toward AC is limited. We review published differences in response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with radiation, the role of adjuvant radical hysterectomy, and optimal chemotherapy for cervical AC. Cervical AC is sufficiently distinct from SCC to warrant specific treatment recommendations; however, lack of data evaluating AC limit recommendations. Additional prospective AC cervix specific research is needed.","title":"Adenocarcinoma of the cervix: should we treat it differently?","pubmedId":"25708801"}
