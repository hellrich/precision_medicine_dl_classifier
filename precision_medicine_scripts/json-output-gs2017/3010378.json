The information base is sufficiently convincing with respect to an enhancing effect as a function of total fat intake and a protective effect of certain dietary fibers in colon cancer. The populations with high incidence of colon cancer are characterized by consumption of high-dietary fat which may be a risk factor in the absence of factors that are protective, such as use of whole-grain cereals, high fibrous foods and vegetables mainly of cruciferous type. Application of the findings made thus far in colon cancer research for the general public is, therefore, to have a far-reaching impact on the major premature, killing diseases in the western world.","title":"Nutritional aspects of colon cancer.","pubmedId":"3010378"}
