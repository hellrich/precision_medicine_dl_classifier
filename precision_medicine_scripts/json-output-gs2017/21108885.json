It has been suggested that individuals with defective CYP2A6 allele are at a lower risk of developing lung cancer. This study is to investigate the frequency of CYP2A6 gene deletion and the relationship of CYP2A6 genetic polymorphism with lung cancer risk in Chinese.\nA case-control study which detected CYP2A6 genotype of 180 patients with lung cancer and 224 controls by PCR-based genotype assay was conducted.\nNo relationship was found between the frequency of CYP2A6 gene deletion and lung cancer risk. There was only one case of CYP2A6 del/del genotype in the controls. The frequency of CYP2A6 del allele was 13.8% in the controls, and 12.8% in lung cancer cases. The CYP2A6 del/del genotype was not found in lung cancer cases.\nThere is no difference in frequency of CYP2A6 gene deletion between lung cancer cases and controls.","title":"[Frequency of CYP2A6 gene deletion and its relation to risk of lung cancer].","pubmedId":"21108885"}
