The frequent occurrence of activating mutations involving exon 11 of c-Kit gene in sporadic GISTs indicates an important role in genesis of this tumor type. In the present study we examined c-Kit gene mutations in a series of GISTs and also in ICCs of surrounding normal tissues. Samples from 18 patients were monitored immunohistochemically for c-Kit expression and microdissected for sequencing analysis of exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 of the c-Kit gene. It was revealed to be mutated in exon 11 or adjacent introns in 9 out of the total of 18 (50.0%) GISTs. In 6 (33.3%) cases, mutations in ICCs were also detected in the same exon. With stomach GISTs, 8 of 16 (50.0%) cases harbored mutations and 4 had mutations in background ICCs (25.0%). In contrast counterpart ICCs in gastric cancer cases harbored no c-Kit gene mutations (0 out of 24\u003d0%) (P\u003c0.02). ICCs undergoing c-Kit mutation as a possible early initiation step in GIST tumorigenesis may thus have pre-neoplastic potential.","title":"Frequent c-Kit gene mutations not only in gastrointestinal stromal tumors but also in interstitial cells of Cajal in surrounding normal mucosa.","pubmedId":"16297706"}
