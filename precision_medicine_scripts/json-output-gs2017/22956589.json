Blood was drawn in 1981-83, and participants were followed until 10 August 2010.\nCopenhagen general population.\n9712 white Danish individuals from the general population aged 20-100 years without rheumatoid arthritis at study entry.\nRheumatoid arthritis according to baseline plasma IgM rheumatoid factor level categories of 25-50, 50.1-100, and \u003e100, versus \u003c25 IU/mL.\nRheumatoid factor levels were similar from age 20 to 100 years. During 187,659 person years, 183 individuals developed rheumatoid arthritis. In healthy individuals, a doubling in levels of rheumatoid factor was associated with a 3.3-fold (95% confidence interval 2.7 to 4.0) increased risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, with a similar trend for most other autoimmune rheumatic diseases. The cumulative incidence of rheumatoid arthritis increased with increasing rheumatoid factor category (P(trend)\u003c0.0001). Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for rheumatoid arthritis were 3.6 (95% confidence interval 1.7 to 7.3) for rheumatoid factor levels of 25-50 IU/mL, 6.0 (3.4 to 10) for 50.1-100 IU/mL, and 26 (15 to 46) for \u003e100 IU/mL, compared with \u003c25 IU/mL (P(trend)\u003c0.0001). The highest absolute 10 year risk of rheumatoid arthritis of 32% was observed in 50-69 years old women who smoked with rheumatoid factor levels \u003e100 IU/mL.\nIndividuals in the general population with elevated rheumatoid factor have up to 26-fold greater long term risk of rheumatoid arthritis, and up to 32% 10 year absolute risk of rheumatoid arthritis. These novel findings may lead to revision of guidelines for early referral to a rheumatologist and early arthritis clinics based on rheumatoid factor testing.","title":"Elevated rheumatoid factor and long term risk of rheumatoid arthritis: a prospective cohort study.","pubmedId":"22956589"}
