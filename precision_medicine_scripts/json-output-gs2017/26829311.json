In the combined discovery and validation cohorts, we identify nine neoplasms with distinct molecular and pathological features. All are invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas or mixed mucinous/nonmucinous adenocarcinomas with mutations of KRAS and frameshift or nonsense mutations of NKX2-1. Immunohistochemical analysis shows that these neoplasms are associated with altered differentiation states, including loss of expression of the pulmonary marker thyroid transcription factor 1 (also called Nkx2.1) and expression of gastrointestinal markers.\nThese findings describe recurrent NKX2-1 mutations in invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas of the lung and support NKX2-1 as a lineage-specific tumor suppressor gene in lung carcinogenesis.","title":"KRAS and NKX2-1 Mutations in Invasive Mucinous Adenocarcinoma of the Lung.","pubmedId":"26829311"}
