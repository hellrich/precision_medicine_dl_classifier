We used a silencing strategy to clarify the effect of reduced FGFR2 expression in human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. The invasive front of cancer cells exhibited stronger FGFR2 expression than the surface area of the cancers. FGFR2 shRNA-transfected LoVo cells inhibited cell migration, invasion and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Thus, FGFR2 plays important roles in CRC progression in association with tumor cell migration, invasion and growth, and FGFR2 might be a novel therapeutic target for CRC.","title":"Overexpressed fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 in the invasive front of colorectal cancer: a potential therapeutic target in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"21745712"}
