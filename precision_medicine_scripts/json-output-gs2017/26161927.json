Effects of KRAS mutation and gene expression levels were assessed on patients\u0027 survival.\nMUC6 (p \u003d 0.009), HGF (p \u003d 0.011), VEGFR-2 (p \u003d 0.020) and VEGFB (p \u003d 0.026) were significantly more expressed and SMAD4 was less suppressed (p \u003d 0.003) in WT KRAS. Contrariwise, SHH (p \u003d 0.012) and IHH (p \u003d 0.031) were more expressed in MT KRAS patients. No OS difference was found between WT and MT KRAS tumors.\nKRAS mutation status seems to identify two different subtypes of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with similar outcome but distinct molecular features and probably different therapeutic targets.","title":"KRAS mutation status is associated with specific pattern of genes expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"26161927"}
