The authors quote 25-year risks of 44.1% for BRCA1 and 33.5% for BRCA2. The risks quoted are somewhat lower than might be inferred from previous estimates in BRCA1/2 carriers, which have been as high as 40% at 10 years . This discrepancy may be explained in part by the decision to exclude index cases in which there may have been testing bias to bilateral disease. However, the authors dismiss a second bias of including many non-carriers in their analysis as \u0027putative\u0027 carriers.
