During the past 3 years, an increased incidence of patients with hepatolithiasis associated with cholangiocarcinoma was noted. Data were needed to reliably determine the incidence of this disease.\nData concerning the relationship between cholangiocarcinoma and hepatolithiasis are presented. The treatment modalities and factors that influence long-term survival are discussed.\nThe overall incidence of cholangiocarcinoma in association with hepatolithiasis was 5.0% (55 in 1105). Before 1987, 65% of cholangiocarcinoma in association with hepatolithiasis was diagnosed postoperatively. After 1987, the incidence of accurate preoperative diagnosis increased (22.8%), and in most of the other instances (62.8%), the diagnosis was made at laparotomy. Surgical procedures consisted of common bile duct exploration with T-tube drainage (100%) and hepatectomy (38.2%). Mortality for patients who underwent surgery was 5.4%; they died of recurrent cholangitis. The overall median survival time of patients with cholangiocarcinoma in association with hepatolithiasis was 10.4 months; the 1-, 2-, and 4-year cumulative survival rates were 30.0%, 12.7%, and 3.6%, respectively. Patients with hepatectomy or the presence of mucobilia had better survival rates (P \u003c 0.05).\nThe overall incidence of hepatolithiasis associated with cholangiocarcinoma was 5%. In most patients with cholangiocarcinoma in association with hepatolithiasis, diagnosis can be made preoperatively and at laparotomy. Patients with hepatectomy or presence of mucobilia had better survival rates.","title":"A reappraisal of cholangiocarcinoma in patient with hepatolithiasis.","pubmedId":"8384069"}
