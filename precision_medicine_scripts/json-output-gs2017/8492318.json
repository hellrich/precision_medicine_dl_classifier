These 19 tumors were selected on the basis of histologically identifiable in situ and invasive components within the primary tumor and associated lymph node metastases. Amplification of c-myc in these areas was then assessed by quantitative PCR assay.\nWe detected gross c-myc amplification in 10 of the tumors examined--eight of the 135 frozen tissue specimens and two of the 19 archival specimens. We selected five of these 10 invasive tumors for further regional analysis. In all four cases where an in situ component was present, amplification of c-myc was present in both the in situ and the invasive components. However, c-myc amplification was present in the corresponding nodal metastases in only two of the four cases where this could be examined.\nThese results suggest that c-myc amplification can occur at an early stage in tumor progression and that amplification does not always persist in the nodal metastasis.","title":"Relationship of c-myc amplification to progression of breast cancer from in situ to invasive tumor and lymph node metastasis.","pubmedId":"8492318"}
