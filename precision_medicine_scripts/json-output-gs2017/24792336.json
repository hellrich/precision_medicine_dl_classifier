However, in the era of molecular-targeted therapy, efficient patient selection is crucial for successful treatment. In this context, an effective method for EML4-ALK detection is necessary. We developed a new highly sensitive variant specific TaqMan based real time PCR assay applicable to RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE).\nThis assay was used to analyze the EML4-ALK gene in 96 non-selected NSCLC specimens and compared with two other methods (end-point PCR and break-apart FISH).\nEML4-ALK was detected in 33/96 (34%) specimens using variant specific real time PCR, whereas in only 23/96 (24%) using end-point PCR. All real time PCR positive samples were confirmed with direct sequencing. A total of 46 specimens were subsequently analyzed by all three detection methods. Using variant specific real time PCR we identified EML4-ALK transcript in 17/46 (37%) specimens, using end-point PCR in 13/46 (28%) specimens and positive ALK rearrangement by FISH was detected in 8/46 (17.4%) specimens. Moreover, using variant specific real time PCR, 5 specimens showed more than one EML4-ALK variant simultaneously (in 2 cases the variants 1+3a+3b, in 2 specimens the variants 1+3a and in 1 specimen the variant 1+3b). In one case of 96 EML4-ALK fusion gene and EGFR mutation were detected. All simultaneous genetic variants were confirmed using end-point PCR and direct sequencing.\nOur variant specific real time PCR assay is highly sensitive, fast, financially acceptable, applicable to FFPE and seems to be a valuable tool for the rapid prescreening of NSCLC patients in clinical practice, so, that most patients able to benefit from targeted therapy could be identified.","title":"TaqMan based real time PCR assay targeting EML4-ALK fusion transcripts in NSCLC.","pubmedId":"24792336"}
