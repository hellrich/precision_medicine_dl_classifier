At univariate analysis, EGFR was significantly more expressed in stage III (50%) than stage I (20%) and stage II (25%) (P \u003c0.03). No correlation with histotype was found. After a median follow-up of 84 months, both median survival time (18 versus 50 months), 2-year (43% versus 70%) and 5-year (31% versus 46%) survival rates of positive cases were significantly lower than negative ones [P \u003c0.001; hazard ratio 1.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-3.30]. At the multivariate analysis, EGFR overexpression and stage emerged as independent factors for cancer-related mortality.\nIn patients with radically resected stage I-IIIA NSCLC, EGFR overexpression predicts shorter survival, thus representing a valuable prognostic factor.","title":"Epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression correlates with a poor prognosis in completely resected non-small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"14679115"}
