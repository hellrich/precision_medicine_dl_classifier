From 1989 to 1997, 51 patients diagnosed with hiliary cholangiocarcinoma were treated in our hospital. Surgery was indicated in 16 with curative aims (group I) while palliative treatment with percutaneous biliary drainage was indicated in 35 (group II). Biliary resection was carried out in 8 patients being associated with hepatic resection in 4 (group IA) and in 8 patients undergoing liver transplantation (group IB). Clinico-epidemiologic data and hospital stay were similar in all the groups. The frequency of complications was similar in groups I and II although the frequency of cholangitis (49%) in group II was noticeable. The percentage of readmissions was also greater in group II (12 vs 46%, respectively; p \u003d 0.03) with prosthesis obstruction being the most frequent cause. Accumulated survival at 1, 2, and 3 years in group I was 84, 64 and 48% with a median survival of 33 months, while in group II the median survival was of 6 months with no patient surviving more than 2 years (p \u003d 0.0001). When groups IA and IB were compared, greater frequency of complications in groups IA (100 vs 37%; p \u003d 0.002), similar frequency of readmissions (87 vs 75%; p \u003d NS), median survival greater in group IB (12.5 months vs 48 months) and significantly higher actuarial survival in group IB (48% in 2 years vs 83% to 2 years; p \u003d 0.02) was observed. In conclusion, surgery is the treatment of choice in hiliary cholangiocarcinoma whenever possible, given the greater survival without a significant increase in morbimortality. Likewise, we consider that liver transplantation is a useful option in the treatment of patients with cholangiocarcinoma type IV of Bismuth.","title":"[Resection as elective treatment of hilar cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor)].","pubmedId":"9644874"}
