Southern blot hybridization analysis demonstrated two- to fivefold amplification of the c-myc gene in 10 cases, i.e., 7 of 13 epidermoid lung carcinomas, 2 of 3 adenocarcinomas and 1 of 1 osteogenic sarcoma metastatic to the lung. Two- to fivefold amplification was observed in tissues from stage III and IV epidermoid carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the lung. A correlation between cancer stage and c-myc gene amplification was found.","title":"Amplification of the c-myc oncogene in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"10774575"}
