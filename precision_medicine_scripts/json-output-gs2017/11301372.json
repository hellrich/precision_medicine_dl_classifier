Most chemotherapy groups have activity in this disease, and the most active single drugs are the taxanes, especially docetaxel (Taxotere; Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Parsippany, NJ), and the anthracyclines. The alkylating agents, antimetabolites, and vinca alkaloids are also widely used. The platinum coordination complexes, which are widely used in oncology, are also active in metastatic breast cancer, but the availability of other drugs that are less toxic and easier to administer has resulted in their having a strictly limited use in this setting. Cisplatin appears to be somewhat more active than carboplatin, but direct comparative studies are lacking. The identification of the prominent activity of the taxanes has led to the investigation of wholly novel non-anthracycline-containing combination regimens, and platinum/taxane doublets appear to be particularly active. More recently, reports that trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA), a novel monoclonal antibody directed against the protein product of the HER2/(neu) oncogene, has a powerful synergistic interaction with docetaxel and with platinum agents have prompted evaluation of the triplet docetaxel/platinum/trastuzumab in the therapy of metastatic breast cancer.","title":"The platinum agents: a role in breast cancer treatment?","pubmedId":"11301372"}
