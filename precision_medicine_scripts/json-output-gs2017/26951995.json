We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the association of PTEN negativity with overall survival and disease-free survival. Thirty-two studies with 4393 patients were identified. PTEN negativity was significantly associated with unfavorable overall survival in breast cancer (hazard ratio\u003d1.89, 95% confidence interval 1.58-2.26), with low heterogeneity among the studies (I(2)\u003d25%, P\u003d0.160) and no evidence for publication bias. Meta-analysis of multivariate hazard ratios and sensitivity analyses did not materially change the results. The data on disease-free survival was heterogeneous (I(2)\u003d61.9%, P\u003c0.001), with a summary hazard ratio of 1.57 (95% confidence interval 1.31-1.89). The exact source of heterogeneity remains unclear. We thus concluded that PTEN negativity was significantly associated with unfavorable prognosis in terms of overall survival in breast cancer.
