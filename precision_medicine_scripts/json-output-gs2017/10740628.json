Several new agents including vinorelbine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, gemcitabine, and irinotecan have been shown to have distinct activity for NSCLC. Combinations of a new agent with cisplatin or carboplatin were highly active for advanced NSCLC, and randomized trials are in progress to establish the standard chemotherapy regimen for advanced NSCLC. The effectiveness of concurrent chemoradiotherapy has been established in Japan, while that of induction chemotherapy has yet to be confirmed. Induction chemoradiotherapy may be useful and randomized trials comparing chemotherapy alone with chemoradiotherapy as an induction therapy are needed.","title":"[Treatment of unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"10740628"}
