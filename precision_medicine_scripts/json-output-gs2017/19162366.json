One-hundred and ninety cases of stage I ADC were examined for KRAS mutations and Ki-67 expression, and their associations with disease recurrence were analyzed. KRAS-mutated cases showed a significantly higher risk of recurrence than cases without mutations (5-year disease-free survival (DFS) 61.0% vs. 85.8%, P\u003d0.017: adjusted Hazard ratio (HR) 4.55, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.61-12.82, P\u003d0.004). Ki-67 high-expressers (labeling index \u003e10%) also showed a higher risk of recurrence than low-expressers (5-year DFS 68.7% vs. 93.2%, P\u003c0.001: adjusted HR 3.84, 95% CI 1.18-12.45, P\u003d0.025). Ki-67 high-expressers with KRAS mutations showed an additional higher risk of recurrence compared to low-expressers without mutations (5-year DFS 37.5% vs. 93.3%, P\u003c0.001: adjusted HR 16.82, 95% CI 3.77-74.98, P\u003c0.001) and their 5-year DFS was nearly equivalent to that of stage II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in our facility (37.5% vs. 37.2% for stage II NSCLC, p\u003d0.577). The combined use of KRAS status and Ki-67 expression level could be an excellent prognostic marker to predict the post-operative recurrence of stage I ADC.","title":"Prognostic value of KRAS mutations and Ki-67 expression in stage I lung adenocarcinomas.","pubmedId":"19162366"}
