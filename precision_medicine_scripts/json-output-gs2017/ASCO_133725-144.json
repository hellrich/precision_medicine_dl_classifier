FGFR1 and 2 amplification (amp) are considered a driver event in many carcinomas.  Methods:  ISO-accredited FGFR1 and 2 FISH assays were run in samples from candidates to enter a PhI clinical study. FGFR amp status was defined as a ratio gene/centromere 2.2. FGFRs status was correlated with available PTEN expression (IHC) and mutations data (AKT, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, among others).  Results:  From January 2012 we screened 272 samples for FGFR1 and 190 for FGFR2. Samples came from primary tumors in 196 cases (PT\u003d71.8%), and 141 (PT\u003d74.2%); and metastatic disease in 61 cases (MET\u003d22.3%), and 41 (21.6%) for FGFR1 and FGFR2, respectively. Rest of cases was of unknown (UKN) origin. Overall, FGFR1 gene amp was observed in 11% and FGFR2 in 3% of cases with amplification rates similar between PT and MET. After subgrouping by tumor origin, FGFR1 ampl was most frequently observed in breast cancer (19%) followed by lung cancer (8%). FGFR2 was amplified in 5% of gastric and gynecological cancers, followed by breast cancer (2.5%).  No associations were observed with FGFR1 and 2 amplifications and PTEN loss. Mutation results were available in 141 and 122 samples with FGFR1 and 2 amp data, respectively. Only one point mutation in AKT and one in PIK3CA genes were observed in FGFR1 amplified samples, while none in FGFR2 amplified cases.  Conclusions:  Incorporation of FGFRs gene amp status in a routine molecular prescreening is feasible and may provide clinicians with a tool to select patients to targeted therapies.FGFR1OrganPT (n.)MET (n.)PT FGFR1 amplMET FGFR1 amplBreast863015 (17,5%)7 (23.3%)Lung and pleura3062 (6,7%)1 (16,6%)Gyn2311 (4.3%)0Stomach2831 (3,6%)0Others / unknown*29211 (3.5%)0FGFR11966120 (10,2%)8 (13,1%)FGFR2OrganPT (n.)MET (n.)PT FGFR2 amplMET FGFR2 amplBreast60211 (1.7%)1 (4,7%)Lung and pleura2300Gyn2011 (5%)0Stomach3841 (2,6%)1 (25%)Others / unknown*211200FGFR2141413 (2,1%)2 (4,9%)* Others \u003d bone, CRC, esoph, liver, skin, soft tissues, thyroid.","title":"Incorporation of FGFR1 and FGFR2 amplification status determination in routine molecular prescreening for targeted therapies.","pubmedId":"ASCO_133725-144"}
