The expression of pCEATK and Ganciclovir (GCV) sensitivity of the transfected cells were tested in vitro and in vivo. pCEATK expressed only in CEA-producing GL cells but not in non-CEA-producing HeLa cells. The sensitivity to GCV of pCEATK-transfected GL was 992 times higher compared with that of the parental cell line and there was obvious \"bystander effect\"in vitro. HeLa cells transfected wtih pCEATK were still resistant to GCV. Injection of GCV resulted in significant regression of pCEATK-transfected GL tumors in nude mice. In addition, all mice with any fraction of GL cells expressing HSV-TK exhibited a significant reduction in tumor growth, including mice with only 10% of GL cells expressing HSV-TK. These results show the possibility of HSV-TK gene-drug therapy using the tumor-specific promoter of CEA gene against CEA-producing lung cancers which was usually refractory to conventional chemotherapy.","title":"Selective gene therapy for human lung adenocarcinoma by tumor-specific expression of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene.","pubmedId":"18762884"}
