Since there are conflicting reports as to the significance of HER2 gene amplification in pancreatic cancer, we undertook this study. We studied HER2 gene amplification, HER2 copy numbers, and chromosome 17 copy numbers using fluorescence in situ hybridization in 63 cases of resected pancreatic cancer. Sixteen tumors (25%) had HER2 gene amplification, 7 (11%) had increased HER2 copy numbers, and 11 (17%) had increased chromosome 17 copy numbers. No statistical significance was found between the genetic parameters and tumor characteristics, stage, or survival. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest case series reporting HER2 gene amplification status and its association with tumor characteristics and survival in pancreatic cancer in the literature. Although a significant percentage (25%) of pancreatic cancers demonstrate amplification of the HER2 gene, we find no association of HER2 gene amplification or chromosome 17 hyperploidy with poorer survival.","title":"HER2 gene amplification and chromosome 17 copy number do not predict survival of patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"18463983"}
