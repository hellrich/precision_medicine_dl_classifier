Despite therapy with surgery, conventional chemotherapy, and radiation, 5-year survival for patients with this diagnosis remains poor. However, advances in the molecular understanding of this malignant disease over the past 5 years might lead to new treatment strategies. Strategies of gene therapy, antiangiogenic treatments, immunotherapy, and signal-transduction inhibition are in preclinical development. This review presents an overview of molecular therapy in pancreatic cancer.","title":"Molecular therapy in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"15337483"}
