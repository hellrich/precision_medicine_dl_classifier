Although it has been appreciated for some time that nearly 95% of PDAC harbor mutationally activated KRAS, to date no effective treatments that target this mutant protein have reached the clinic. A number of studies have shown that oncogenic KRAS plays a central role in controlling tumor metabolism by orchestrating multiple metabolic changes including stimulation of glucose uptake, differential channeling of glucose intermediates, reprogrammed glutamine metabolism, increased autophagy, and macropinocytosis. We review these recent findings and address how they may be applied to develop new PDAC treatments. ","title":"KRAS: feeding pancreatic cancer proliferation.","pubmedId":"24388967"}
