Patients were followed-up and clinico-pathological parameters and overall survival (OS) were evaluated.\nThe expression of LKB1 mRNA and protein was lower in gastric-cancer cell lines and tumor tissues compared to normal gastric cells (p\u003c0.05) and tissues (p\u003c0.001). Decreased expression of LKB1 mRNA and protein in patients with gastric cancer was significantly inversely related to TNM stage, T-stage (depth of invasion), lymph-node metastasis and vascular invasion (p\u003c0.05). Patients showing high LKB1 mRNA and high LKB1 protein expression had a significantly longer OS and better 5-year survival rate than those with low mRNA expression (61.3 months vs. 56.1 months and 75% vs. 58.7%, p\u003c0.05, respectively) and low protein expression (64.8 months vs. 55.7 months and 72.9% vs. 64.5%, p\u003c0.05, respectively). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that both LKB1 mRNA and protein expression in gastric cancer were independent prognostic factors for OS.\nPatients with gastric cancer with decreased expression of LKB1 have a poor prognosis with a lower survival rate.","title":"Decreased Expression of Tumor-suppressor Gene LKB1 Correlates with Poor Prognosis in Human Gastric Cancer.","pubmedId":"26976973"}
