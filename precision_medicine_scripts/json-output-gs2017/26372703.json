We aimed to evaluate whether mutant forms of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) (mEGFR and mKRAS) are useful biomarkers in resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nWe retrospectively reviewed data from 841 patients who underwent surgery and molecular testing for NSCLC between 2007 and 2012.\nmEGFR was observed in 103 patients (12.2%), and mKRAS in 265 (31.5%). The median overall survival (OS) and time to recurrence (TTR) were significantly lower for mKRAS (OS: 43 months; TTR: 19 months) compared with mEGFR (OS: 67 months; TTR: 24 months) and wild-type patients (OS: 55 months; disease-free survival (DFS): 24 months). Patients with KRAS G12V exhibited worse OS and TTR compared with the entire cohort (OS: KRAS G12V: 26 months vs\n60 months; DFS: KRAS G12V: 15 months vs\n24 months). These results were confirmed using multivariate analyses (non-G12V status, hazard ratio (HR): 0.43 (confidence interval: 0.28-0.65), P\u003c0.0001 for OS; HR: 0.67 (0.48-0.92), P\u003d0.01 for TTR). Risk of recurrence was significantly lower for non-KRAS G12V (HR: 0.01, (0.001-0.08), P\u003c0.0001).\nmKRAS and mEGFR may predict survival and recurrence in early stages of NSCLC. Patients with KRAS G12V exhibited worse OS and higher recurrence incidences.","title":"Prognostic value of the KRAS G12V mutation in 841 surgically resected Caucasian lung adenocarcinoma cases.","pubmedId":"26372703"}
