According to our view on senescence, the role of p21 and p16 is to cause cell cycle arrest, whereas MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) drives geroconversion to senescence. Recently we demonstrated that one of the markers of p21- and p16-initiated senescence is MEK-dependent hyper-elevation of cyclin D1. We noticed that a synthetic inhibitor of CDK 4/6 (PD0332991) also induced cyclin D1-positive senescence. We demonstrated that PD0332991 and p21 caused almost identical senescence phenotypes. p21, p16, and PD0332991 do not inhibit MTOR, and rapamycin decelerates geroconversion caused by all 3 molecules. Like p21, PD0332991 initiated senescence at any concentration that inhibited cell proliferation. This confirms the notion that a mere arrest in the presence of active MTOR may lead to senescence.
