Indeed, diagnosis remains difficult, since symptoms are often unspecific and appear at latest stages. This article presents an update of recent data and therapeutic options.\nSeveral etiologic factors have been identified, but for most patients, none of these factors can be found. Prognosis is often poor, and remains difficult to establish because of the lack of sufficient large-scale studies looking at the impact on preexisting tumor characteristics on overall survival. Surgery remains when possible the gold standard. When tumor removal is impossible, due to a local extension, the appropriate care of patients remains to be defined. Chemotherapy has been proposed with evidence of objective response but limited data on its ability to prolong overall survival and to enhance quality of life. Active chemotherapies appear to be made from combination of an antimetabolite, such as 5-fluorouracile or gemcitabine, and a platinum drug.\nIn the near future, indications of chemotherapy could be enlarged and targeted therapy might also be used, since several molecules have been tested in preclinical studies, and be offered to patients in clinical trials.","title":"[Cholangiocarcinoma: epidemiology and global management].","pubmedId":"18272258"}
