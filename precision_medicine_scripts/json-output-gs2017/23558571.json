A recent study suggested a prognostic role of MET expression in Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma (cHL). The purpose of this study was to examine the prognostic significance of MET and MST1R expression in cHL. The prognostic impact of MET and MST1R was examined in 100 patients with cHL (median age: 32 years) by immunohistochemistry and mRNA in situ hybridization. The median follow-up time was 95 months (interquartile range: 42-126 months). MET or MST1R protein expression was associated with high MET or MST1R mRNA expression, respectively. Thirty-eight patients (38%) expressed MET protein in HRS cell, which was associated with better overall survival (P\u003d0.004). Twenty-six patients (26%) expressed MST1R protein, which was associated with better overall survival (P\u003d0.022) and event-free survival (P\u003d0.021). Multivariate analysis identified MET protein as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and MST1R protein as an independent prognostic factor for event-free survival. Subgroup analysis according to Ann Arbor stage showed that expressions of MET and MST1R protein have prognostic impact in the advanced stage only. In particular, coexpression of MST1R and MET protein was associated with a better survival outcome than MET or MST1R expression alone or no expression. This study suggests that MET and MST1R are independent prognostic factors in classical cHL, and may allow the identification of a subgroup of cHL patients who require more intensive therapy.","title":"MET and MST1R as prognostic factors for classical Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma.","pubmedId":"23558571"}
