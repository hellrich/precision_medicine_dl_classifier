In approximately 5 % of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), an oncogenic fusion gene of echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) and ALK has been detected using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Moreover, various methods including immunohistochemistry and PCR-based assays can be used for analysing ALK expression. Clinical data have been generated for crizotinib, a small molecule inhibitor of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase, demonstrating a substantial improvement of objective response rate and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared to standard chemotherapy in pretreated NSCLC patients harbouring EML4-ALK fusion genes. In the current review, recent data on the detection and inhibition of ALK in advanced NSCLC are summarised.","title":"[Crizotinib - molecular therapy for lung cancer].","pubmedId":"23576200"}
