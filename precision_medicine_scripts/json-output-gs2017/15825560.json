A better understanding of the factors that contribute to these observations, including potential factors associated with pregnancy, could enable design of more effective adjuvant therapies.\nWe describe the presentation of a meningioma during the immediate postpartum period. Serial imaging demonstrated subsequent rapid decrease in size of the tumour prior to any intervention. The lesion was resected, and the tissue was subjected to immunostaining for gene products associated with pregnancy, including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor B (PDGFRB), fibroblastic growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR-2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human placental lactogen (hPL).\nThe lesion proved to be an atypical fibroblastic meningioma grade II (WHO). Immunostaining demonstrated significant staining for PR, PDGFRB, and FGFR-2. No specific staining for ER, EGFR, or hPL was identified.\nAlthough clinical regression of meningioma following pregnancy is well-recognized, imaging data are much less abundant. This report provides clear clinical and imaging documentation of a meningioma associated with pregnancy. In addition, the growth factor profile of this tumour suggests the importance of PR, PDGFRB, and FGFR-2 as potential therapeutic targets.","title":"Sex steroid and growth factor profile of a meningioma associated with pregnancy.","pubmedId":"15825560"}
