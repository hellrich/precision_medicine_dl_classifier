Despite the increase in its incidence, this tumor remains extremely rare in Western countries and few reports detailing experience with surgical resection have been published. The aim of this study was to analyze the experience with resection of IHCC in our center.\nFrom 1987 to 2003 we observed 35 patients with IHCC; 15 of them (42.8%) were submitted to hepatic resection. IHCCs accounted for 13% of all liver resections for primary liver tumors carried out at our center during this period. According to the classification of the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan, the tumors were classified as \"mass-forming\" in 14 cases and as \"periductal\" in one case. Major resections were performed in ten cases and minor resections in five cases. In the patient with a periductal tumor a major resection was performed along with excision of the main biliary confluence. In 14 cases (93.3%) tumor-free resection margins were obtained.\nThe intraoperative mortality was nil and the postoperative mortality 6.6%. The postoperative morbidity rate was 21.4%. The mean overall survival was 38.4 months, with 86% and 49% one- and three-year survival rates, respectively. Patients with mass-forming tumors and curative resections (R0) (mean survival 40.8 months; one- and three-year survival rates 92.3% and 52.7%), and those with TNM stage I-II tumors (mean survival 43.7 months; one- and three-year survival rates 100% and 66.7%) had a longer survival. The patient with the periductal tumor and R1 resection died after seven months.\nThese results support a surgical approach based on accurate selection of patients with IHCC and aimed at radical resection whenever possible. The good survival rates observed in R0 resections emphasize the role of radical surgery as the only chance of cure for patients with this tumor.","title":"Liver resection for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"16457147"}
