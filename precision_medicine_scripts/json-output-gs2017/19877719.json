In this study, we aimed to unravel molecular meningioma tumorigenesis and discover novel protein biomarkers for diagnostic and/or prognostic purposes and performed in-depth proteomic profiling of meningioma cells compared to human primary arachnoidal cells. We isolated proteins from meningioma cell line SF4433 and human primary arachnoidal cells and analyzed the protein profiles by Gel-nanoLC-MS/MS in conjunction with protein identification and quantification by shotgun nanoLC tandem mass spectrometry and spectral counting. Differential analysis of meningiomas revealed changes in the expression levels of 281 proteins (P \u003c 0.01) associated with various biological functions such as DNA replication, recombination, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Among several interesting proteins, we focused on a subset of the highly significantly up-regulated proteins, the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) family. We performed subsequent validation studies by qRT-PCR in human meningioma tissue samples (WHO grade I, 14 samples; WHO grade II, 7 samples; and WHO grade III, 7 samples) compared to arachnoidal tissue controls (from fresh autopsies; 3 samples) and found that MCMs are highly and significantly up-regulated in human meningioma tumor samples compared to arachnoidal tissue controls. We found a significant increase in MCM2 (8 fold), MCM3 (5 fold), MCM4 (4 fold), MCM5 (4 fold), MCM6 (3 fold), and MCM7 (5 fold) expressions in meningiomas. This study suggests that MCM family proteins are up-regulated in meningiomas and can be used as diagnostic markers.","title":"Comparative protein profiling reveals minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins as novel potential tumor markers for meningiomas.","pubmedId":"19877719"}
