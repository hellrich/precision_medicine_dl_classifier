Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute, the authors investigated whether there is a similar relationship between breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer in men. The observed-expected ratio was not significantly elevated for either colorectal cancer after breast cancer or for breast cancer after colorectal cancer in men. There was an increased incidence of prostate cancer after colorectal cancer, but this relationship was not present in the opposite direction and is believed to result from detection bias. There was an increased incidence of breast and colorectal cancer in women. These results suggest that the observed breast and colorectal cancer relationship in women may be a result of shared reproductive hormonal factors.","title":"The association of breast cancer and colorectal cancer in men.
