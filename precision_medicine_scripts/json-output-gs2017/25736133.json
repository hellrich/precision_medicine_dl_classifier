Flow cytometry was used to analyze apoptosis and cell cycle of the transfected cells, and the expression of PTEN was detected after transfection.\nThe cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-mTOR showed a increased growth rate than those transfected with the non-loaded plasmid and those without transfection. The expression of the protein PTEN decreased obviously in the cells after mTOR trasnfection.\nmTOR can regulate the expression of PTEN via PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathways through a negative feedback mechanism. Increased mTOR expression promotes MCF-7 cell growth, suggesting the potential value of mTOR specific inhibitor in the treatment of breast cancer.","title":"[Effect of mTOR plasmid transfection on growth of breast cancer MCF-7 cells in vitro].","pubmedId":"25736133"}
