Multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) was used to detect chromosomal alterations. Single- strand conformation analysis and sequencing were performed to study BRAF, neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene homolog (NRAS), v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (c-KIT), melanocortin 1 receptor (alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone receptor) (MC1R), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) genes.\nBRAFV600E mutation was detected in 54% of cell lines. NRAS was mutated in one cell line also carrying multiple copies of NRAS. All cell lines with MC1R variants harboured BRAFV600E. Concurrent loss of MUTYH (1p33), gains of c-MYC (8q24) and of CDK6 (7q21) were found to be significantly associated in cell lines (45%) that harboured biallelic 9p21 deletions including CDKN2B-CDKN2A-MTAP.\nThese data suggest the existence of a specific pattern of somatic alterations in genes that are involved in DNA repair (MUTYH) and in cell cycle regulation (c-MYC, CDK6, CDKN2A and CDKN2B). Interestingly, all MC1R variants were associated with BRAFV600E and all cell lines from visceral metastases harboured BRAFV600E.","title":"Molecular characterization of human cutaneous melanoma-derived cell lines.","pubmedId":"22493355"}
