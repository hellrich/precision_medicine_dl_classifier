However, little is known about the expression of various HDACs and their associations with BRAF/NRAS mutation status, clinicopathologic characteristics, and patient outcome. The present study extensively profiled HDAC class 1 and their targets/regulators utilizing immunohistochemistry in human melanoma samples from patients with stage IV melanoma, known BRAF/NRAS mutational status, and detailed clinicopatholgical data. HDAC8 was increased in BRAF-mutated melanoma (P\u003d0.016), however, no association between expression of other HDACs and NRAS/BRAF status was identified. There was also a correlation between HDAC1, HDAC8 expression, and phosphorylated NFκb p65 immunoreactivity (P\u003c0.001). Increased cytoplasmic HDAC8 immunoreactivity was independently associated with an improved survival from both diagnosis of primary melanoma and from first detection of stage IV disease to melanoma death on multivariate analysis (HR 0.992, 95% CI 0.987-0.996; P\u003c0.001 and HR 0.993, 95% CI 0.988-0.998; P\u003d0.009, respectively). These results suggest not only that HDAC8 may be a prognostic biomarker in melanoma, but also provide important data regarding the regulation of HDACs in melanoma and a rational basis for targeting them therapeutically.
