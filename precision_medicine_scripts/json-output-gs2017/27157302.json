{"genes":["Luminal A","Luminal B","HER2","neu","growth factor receptors"],"organisms":["6755"],"publicationTypes":["Journal Article"],"abstract":"With advances in gene microarray technologies, the classification of breast cancers has been revised to take into account new information based on common genetic factors that are associated with clinically significant subgroups. At present, breast cancer is divided into 4 major subgroups, Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2/neu positive, and Basal-like. Many breast cancer researchers believe that this classification scheme will change with further subdivision of these categories in various prognostic subgroups. The presence of hormone or growth factor receptors is a key factor in the current classification. Beyond their interest as biomarkers associated with specific subgroups of breast cancer, the expression of receptors in breast cancer has profound therapeutic implications. Given the importance of these receptors in the management of breast cancer, many receptor-binding radiotracers have been developed over the past 30 years. In this article, the current status of receptor-binding radiotracers in breast cancer is reviewed. ","title":"Receptor Imaging in Patients with Breast Cancer.","pubmedId":"27157302"}
