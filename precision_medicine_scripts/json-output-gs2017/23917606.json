Laparoscopy can be performed for tumors located in the greater curvature of the stomach. Among the treatment alternatives, a single-incision laparoscopic technique is used more frequently than standard laparoscopy due to the successful results of laparoscopic surgery. Here, we report the use of single-incision surgical glove-port laparoscopy for the resection of 2 gastrointestinal stromal tumors localized in the greater curvature of stomach.
