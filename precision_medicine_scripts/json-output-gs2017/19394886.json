The role of aromatase inhibitors as alternative to tamoxifen therapy in the adjuvant setting of breast cancer is discussed. The eventual implications of the presumed association of uterine carcinosarcoma and tamoxifen therapy on the choice of the therapeutic agent in the adjuvant setting of hormone-sensitive breast cancer are discussed.","title":"[Tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting for breast cancer: Reflexions about the risk of uterine carcinosarcoma].","pubmedId":"19394886"}
