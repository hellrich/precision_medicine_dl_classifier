Here, we have investigated the chromosomal status of CDX2 in human sporadic colorectal cancers with the phenotype of chromosomal instability. Allelic imbalance determination showed frequent rearrangements at the CDX2 locus. The rearrangements correlated with CDX2 gene amplification, as assessed by quantitative PCR analysis. However, they were not predictive of the Cdx2 protein pattern. These data suggest that mechanisms other than structural alterations at the CDX2 locus account for the change of expression in colorectal cancers.","title":"Frequent rearrangements and amplification of the CDX2 homeobox gene in human sporadic colorectal cancers with chromosomal instability.","pubmedId":"16730885"}
