Radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, and hormonal therapy are the main conventional treatments. However, gene therapy is emerging as a promising adjuvant to conventional strategies, and several clinical trials are in progress. Here, we outline several approaches to gene therapy for prostate cancer that have been investigated. Methods of gene delivery are described, particularly those that have commonly been used in research on prostate cancer. We discuss efforts to achieve tissue-specific gene delivery, focusing on the use of tissue-specific gene promoters. Finally, the present use of gene therapy for prostate cancer is evaluated. The ability to deliver gene-therapy vectors directly to prostate tissue, and to regulate gene expression in a tissue-specific manner, offers promise for the use of gene therapy in prostate cancer.","title":"Gene-based therapy in prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"15288235"}
