We present ocular findings, imaging techniques applied, pathological findings of the space-occupying lesions, and therapy. One of these patients, the daughter of one of the other individuals, presented with a large neck mass, but no surgically treatable findings associated with the external growth of the meningioma. The patients complained of symptoms associated with the extracranial portion of the intracranial meningioma, rather than of the intracranial primaries. However, facial and neck surgical care is very limited in patients with such advanced-stage tumours. The prolongation of life was unquestionably predominantly determined by the behaviour of the intracranial tumour. Head and neck surgeons should be aware of the rare possibility that solid tumours of this region could be extracranial-extending meningioma in an inherited disease.
