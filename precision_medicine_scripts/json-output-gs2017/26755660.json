The present study identifies a functional lncRNA and its potential role in tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer. Microarray co-assay for lncRNAs and mRNAs demonstrates that lncRNA-NUTF2P3-001 is remarkably overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis tissues, which positively correlates with KRAS mRNA expression. After downregulating lncRNA-NUTF2P3-001, the proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cell are significantly inhibited both in vitro and vivo, accompanying with decreased KRAS expression. The dual-luciferase reporter assay further validates that lncRNA-NUTF2P3-001 and 3\u0027UTR of KRAS mRNA competitively bind with miR-3923. Furthermore, miR-3923 overexpression simulates the inhibiting effects of lncRNA-NUTF2P3-001-siRNA on pancreatic cancer cell, which is rescued by miR-3923 inhibitor. Specifically, the present study further reveals that lncRNA-NUTF2P3-001 is upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells under hypoxia and CoCl2 treatment, which is attributed to the binding of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) to hypoxia response elements (HREs) in the upstream of KRAS promoter. Data from pancreatic cancer patients show a positive correlation between lncRNA-NUTF2P3-001 and KRAS, which is associated with advanced tumor stage and worse prognosis. Hence, our data provide a new lncRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism for the tumor oncogene KRAS and implicate that lncRNA-NUTF2P3-001 and miR-3923 can be applied as novel predictors and therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer.","title":"Hypoxia-induced lncRNA-NUTF2P3-001 contributes to tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer by derepressing the miR-3923/KRAS pathway.","pubmedId":"26755660"}
