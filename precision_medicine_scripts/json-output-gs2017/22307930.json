The ear-nose-throat location of lipoleiomyosarcoma has not been previously described.\nA 37-year-old man with a dysphagia had a dyspnea after an endoscopy. A large tumor was exteriorized from the man\u0027s mouth. The lesion was pedicled to the epiglottis. A histologic examination determined that the tumor was a lipoleiomyosarcoma. MDM2 and CDK4 gene amplification were positive. Due to the risk of recurrence, a second intervention was performed to complete the excision.\nThese tumors develop in cavities slowly and gradually. The treatment of this lesion is surgical with a sufficient resection margin.","title":"Lipoleiomyosarcoma of the larynx.","pubmedId":"22307930"}
