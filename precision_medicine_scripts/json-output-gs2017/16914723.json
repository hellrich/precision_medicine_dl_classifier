In most cases these effects are mediated, at least in part, by insulin receptor substrates (IRS), one of which is insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). R-Ras is a member of the Ras family of GTPases and is involved in a variety of biological processes, including integrin activation, cell migration, and control of cell proliferation. Here we demonstrate that both R-Ras and BCAR3, a regulator of R-Ras activity that has been implicated in breast cancer, regulate the level of IRS-1 protein in estrogen-dependent MCF-7 and ZR75 breast cancer cells. In particular, expression of a constitutively activated R-Ras mutant, R-Ras38V, or of BCAR3 accelerates the degradation of IRS-1, leading to the impairment of signaling through insulin but not epidermal growth factor receptors. Moreover, knockdown of endogenous R-Ras levels in MCF-7 cells inhibits IRS-1 degradation induced by estrogen signaling blockade but not by long-term insulin treatment. Consistent with these results, both R-Ras38V expression and estrogen signaling blockade lead to the degradation of IRS-1, at least in part, through calpain activity. These findings show that R-Ras activity mediates inhibition of insulin signaling associated with suppression of estrogen action, implicating this GTPase in a growth-inhibitory mechanism associated with antiestrogen treatment of breast cancer.","title":"The R-Ras GTPase mediates cross talk between estrogen and insulin signaling in breast cancer cells.","pubmedId":"16914723"}
