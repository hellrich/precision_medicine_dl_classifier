New therapies targeting the molecular regulatory machinery were required imperatively. MicroRNAs and long noncoding RNAs can respectively or cooperatively function as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in human cancers. The present study identified that miR-449a was down-regulated in tissue of human lung cancer. In this study, we aimed to investigate the function of miR-449a in NL9980 and L9981 lung carcinoma cells lines and the relationship with lncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1).\nmiR-449a was profiled in several lung carcinoma cell lines by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR. We analyzed the effects of miR-449a overexpression on proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle in L9981 cells. The regulatory relationship between miR-449a and NEAT1 was predicted in silico and further studied by miR-449a inhibitor and mimics assay.\nmiR-449a was expressed in four cell lines, which we selected, however miR-449a was in high level in NL9980 and in low level in L9981 (P \u003c 0.05). When the miR-449a was the overexpression in L9981 cells, the cell growth was suppressed, and the apoptosis cells were promoted compared with the control group (P \u003c 0.05). The G1/G0 became longer and S, G2/M became shorter (P \u003c 0.05) by miR-449a overexpression. Further study of the interaction between miR-449a and NEAT1 show that NEAT1 was up-regulated when cells were transfected with miR-449a inhibitor, and NEAT1 was down-regulated when cells transfected with miR-449a mimics.\nOur data indicate that miR-449a may function as a suppressor of lung cancer, and affects the expression of NEAT1 in lung cancer cells.","title":"MicroRNA-449a inhibits cell growth in lung cancer and regulates long noncoding RNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1.","pubmedId":"25818739"}
