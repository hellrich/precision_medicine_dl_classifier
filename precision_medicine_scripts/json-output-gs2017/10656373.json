Thirty-three were diagnosed with atypical meningioma. Eleven of the excluded patients had incomplete records, were lost to follow-up, or received treatment elsewhere. Of the 22 evaluable patients, 15 underwent gross total resection (GTR), 4 had a subtotal resection (STR), and 3 had a resection of unknown extent. Eight patients received radiation therapy (2 after initial resection and 6 after at least one recurrence). The median radiation dose was 5,400 cGy (range 3,500-5,940). The median age at presentation was 55.5 years, the male:female ratio was 14:8, and 19/22 patients had a Karnofsky performance score (KPS) \u003e or \u003d80. The independent variables analyzed for overall survival and local control were gender, KPS (\u003e or \u003d80 vs. \u003c 80), extent of surgery (GTR vs. STR or unknown extent of surgery), and postoperative radiation therapy.\nMedian survival was 10.6 years, with a median follow-up of 5.5 years (range 1.5-14.8). Eight of the 22 patients had local recurrence, including 2/15 with GTR, 3/4 with STR, and all 3 patients who underwent resection of unknown extent. At 10 years, patients with GTR had a higher local control rate than those who had either a STR or a resection of unknown extent (87% vs. 17%; p \u003d 0.02). The 5- and 10-year overall survival rates for the entire group were 91% and 76%, respectively. Patients who had GTR had 5- and 10-year overall survival of 87% and 87%, respectively. Patients with STR or resection of unknown extent had 5- and 10-year overall survival rates of 100% and 75%, respectively.\nIn patients with atypical meningiomas, gross total resection is associated with a lower recurrence rate than in subtotal resection.","title":"Local control and overall survival in atypical meningioma: a retrospective study.","pubmedId":"10656373"}
