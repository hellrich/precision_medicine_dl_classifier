Increased BMI is associated with health problems, but there is limited evidence linking GWG directly to later health in black women. We examined the association between GWG and health conditions 18 years after a first birth.\nThis study was a secondary data analysis of 467 urban black women, enrolled during pregnancy (1990-1991). GWG was the difference between self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and measured weight at delivery. Hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and self-reported health were assessed with self-report and measurements of blood pressure, height, and weight, approximately 18 years after first childbirth.\nHigher pre-pregnancy BMI was associated with increased probability of each health condition. Higher GWG was associated with hypertension for women with a pre-pregnancy BMI under 21.3 kg/m(2) (P \u003c .05) and obesity for women with a pre-pregnancy BMI under 25.9 kg/m(2) (P \u003c .05). Diabetes and poor health were not associated with GWG.\nGWG may impact a mother\u0027s hypertension and obesity status 18 years after childbirth for underweight and normal weight women.","title":"Gestational Weight Gain and Health Outcomes 18 Years Later in Urban Black Women.","pubmedId":"25994417"}
