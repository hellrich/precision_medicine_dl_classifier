Homozygous deletion or methylation of p14(ARF) was detected in 10 (56%) PCNSLs, and they were almost entirely deletions (except 1 case). A total of 11 (61%) PCNSLs demonstrated homozygous deletion (6 cases) or methylation (5 cases) of p16(INK4a). Six tumors showed both p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) homozygous deletions. Hypermethylation of the RB1 and the p27(Kip1) promoter region was detected in 2 (11%) cases, whereas p21(Waf1) methylation was not detected in any. Immunohistochemistry revealed loss of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) expression in 10 (56%) samples, correlating with the gene status. Four cases showed independent negative immunoreactivity for pRB and p27(Kip1), and nearly one-half of cases (8 of 18; 44%) were characterized by lack of p21(Waf1) expression. These results indicate that inactivation of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) by either homozygous deletion or promoter hypermethylation represents an important molecular pathogenesis in PCNSLs. Hypermethylation of RB1, p21(Waf1), and p27(Kip1) appears to be of minor significance, these genes being independently methylated in PCNSLs.","title":"Frequent alterations of the p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) genes in primary central nervous system lymphomas.","pubmedId":"11522621"}
