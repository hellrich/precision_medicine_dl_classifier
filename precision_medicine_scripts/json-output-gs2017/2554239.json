Differences in the frequencies of amplification could be observed between these two series for c-myc (9.3% vs. 20.8%) and hst/int-2 (21.5% vs. 15.6%) whereas similar values were found for c-erbB-2 (22.5% vs. 20.3%). Statistical correlations between amplification and disease parameters were also dependent on population sampling. Therefore we performed our statistical analysis on the pooled populations and focused on the 219 primary breast carcinomas from patients without therapy prior to surgery. Amplification of c-erbB-2 was strongly correlated to the absence of either estrogen (ER-, P \u003d 0.003) or progesterone (PR-, P \u003d 0.004) receptors. An amplified c-myc was significantly associated with PR- (P \u003d 0.005) and was prevalent in high grade tumors. On the contrary, hst/int-2 amplification was correlated to PR+ tumors (P \u003d 0.01) and was more frequent in ER+ and low grade tumors, and was also correlated with lymph node involvement (P \u003d 0.04). Our data suggest that amplification of each of these proto-oncogenes could be representative of a particular subset of breast tumors. Therefore, proto-oncogene amplification may be helpful in characterizing new biological subclasses in human breast cancer.","title":"Proto-oncogene amplification and human breast tumor phenotype.","pubmedId":"2554239"}
