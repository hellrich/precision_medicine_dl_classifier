Existing methods of diagnosing pancreatic cancer such as tumor markers, endoscopy, and radiological imaging lack the sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis, particularly in a background of chronic pancreatitis. Molecular based strategies offer new avenues of screening for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in these high-risk patients, which may allow the development of highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tests for the early detection of cancer.","title":"Screening for early pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in hereditary pancreatitis.","pubmedId":"10872428"}
