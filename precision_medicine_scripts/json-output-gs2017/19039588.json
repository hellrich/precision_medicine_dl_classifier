Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX-2) have been described to correlate with progression of melanoma. Moreover, activating mutations in BRAF/NRAS oncogenes are often detected in melanoma. The BRAF/NRAS mutation status and expression of COX-2 and iNOS were examined to compare their prognostic value for overall survival (OS) in stage III malignant cutaneous melanoma.\nThe expression of iNOS and COX-2 in metastatic lymph nodes from 21 rapidly progressing (OS from date of diagnosis of stage III disease \u003c or \u003d14 months) and 17 slowly progressing (OS \u003e or \u003d60 months) stage III cutaneous melanoma patients was examined by immunohistochemistry. The presence of BRAF/NRAS mutations was analyzed using direct DNA sequencing. Chi2 exact trend test and logistic regression analysis were used for statistical analysis.\nBoth iNOS (P \u003d 0.002) and COX-2 (P \u003d 0.048) alone significantly predicted OS. The BRAF/NRAS mutation status did not significantly differ between patient groups, although iNOS significantly (P \u003d 0.013) correlated with BRAF mutation frequency. Furthermore, the odds ratio (OR) with respect to OS of iNOS (OR \u003d 10.4) was higher than that of COX-2 (OR \u003d 5.6) and was stable in the multivariate analysis of OS together with disease stage IIIB/C, ulceration, number of metastatic lymph nodes, and Breslow tumor thickness.\nOur data show that iNOS is an independent and stronger prognostic factor for OS in stage III malignant cutaneous melanoma than COX-2.","title":"Prognostic significance of tumor iNOS and COX-2 in stage III malignant cutaneous melanoma.","pubmedId":"19039588"}
