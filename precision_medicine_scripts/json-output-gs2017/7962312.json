The characteristics of diabetes presenting within the 2 yr before the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer were also investigated.\nWhereas diabetes is a risk factor for the development of pancreatic cancer, the diagnosis of a pancreatic tumor in some cases is preceded by a brief history of diabetes, which appears to be caused by the malignancy itself. This diabetes may be atypical with regard to a lack of family history of diabetes, absence of obesity, and a rapid progression to insulin dependence.\nRecognition of atypical diabetes as an early manifestation of pancreatic cancer could lead to earlier diagnosis of tumors at a stage when they are still amenable to resection and cure.","title":"Clinical review 63: Diabetes and pancreatic cancer: clues to the early diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy.","pubmedId":"7962312"}
