First-line therapy included intraarterial approaches with gemcitabine + mitomycin-C and intravenous systemic treatments with gemcitabine, gemcitabine + mitomycin-C and oxaliplatin, respectively. In addition, it was the aim to improve survival by adding second- and third-line chemotherapies, mainly including high dose 5-FU/FA and irinotecan resp. alone or in combinations. Follow-up included clinical investigations, imaging methods and determination of tumor markers. Evaluation of efficacy followed the WHO guidelines. The results indicated the intraarterial locoregional treatment of exocrine pancreatic cancer with a combination of mitomycin-C + gemcitabine as a highly effective treatment modality with PR + CR of 40% measured by imaging methods and 81% analysed by tumor marker determinations. The survival analyses suggested relevant prolongation of survival in relation to the number of effective second- and/or third-line therapies (0/1/\u003e 1) with median survival--based on the imaging data--of 7, 11 and 20 months for Mo tumors and 3, 8 and 14 months for tumor diseases with liver metastases at time of admission, respectively. Relevant preconditions for second- and/or third-line therapies of pancreatic carcinomas are given by more or less effective first-line treatment modalities of this cancer disease on the one hand and by the actual diagnostic aids allowing the beginning of first-line therapy as well as the detection of recurrence early enough to try a second- or third-line therapy before clinical/ethical aspects prevent further antitumoral treatment trials in the individual patient.","title":"Improvement of survival by efficacy orientated sequential polychemotherapy of exocrine pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"11326695"}
