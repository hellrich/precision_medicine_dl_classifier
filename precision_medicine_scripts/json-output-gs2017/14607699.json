The positive expression rates of the three specific proteins increased more significantly in the PC group than in the NP and CP groups (P\u003c0.05). The individual expression of c-erbB-2, EGFR and TGF-beta1 was not related to the age and sex of the patients as well as the site, size and histopathological grade of tumors (P\u003e0.05), but to the clinical stage of tumors (P\u003c0.01). The coexpression rate of the three proteins was 27.8% (10/36). This coexpression in the PC group was correlated with the histopathological grades and clinical stages of tumors (P\u003c0.01).\nDetection of c-erbB-2 oncogene protein, EGFR, and TGF-beta1 expressions in pancreatic tissue is helpful to judge the malignancy, progression, and metastasis of PC.","title":"Expression of c-erbB-2 oncogene protein, epidermal growth factor receptor, and TGF-beta1 in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"14607699"}
