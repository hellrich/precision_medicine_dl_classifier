Four subtypes of FGFR were expressed in 7-day and 9-day chick embryonic RPE. CPE-FGFR was expressed not only in RPE but also in whole embryos. The differential expression of FGFR subtypes in RPE at different stages suggests the possibility that FGFs influence the differentiation of RPE through the control of FGFR expression.","title":"[Analysis of fibroblast growth factor receptor genes expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium of chick embryos by in situ hybridization].","pubmedId":"8067294"}
