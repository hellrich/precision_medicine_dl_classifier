Methods: BRAF V600E/K MM pts naive to BRAF and MEK inhibitors were enrolled. Part B (Ph I, n \u003d 77 BRAFi-naive) pts enrolled into escalating dose (mg) cohorts of dabrafenib twice daily (BID)/trametinib once daily (QD) as follows: 75/1, 150/1, 150/1.5 and 150/2. Part C (Ph II, n\u003d162) pts were randomized 1:1:1 to dabrafenib 150 mg monotherapy, 150/1 and 150/2. Crossover from monotherapy to 150/2 combination was allowed post-progression of disease. Primary endpoints were progression-free survival, response rate, duration of response, and safety; secondary endpoints were OS and pharmacokinetics.  Results:  Previously reported landmark 2-year OS results for pts in Parts B and C with median follow-up of 35 and 34 mo is presented in Table 1.In Part C, median OS rate for 150/2 combination pts was 25 mo (HR \u003d 0.79 vs monotherapy; p \u003d 0.3341). OS rate for monotherapy was confounded by crossover to the 150/2 arm; 45 (83%) pts crossed over at time of analysis. In the 150/2 arm, 16 (30%) pts continued to receive combination beyond progressive disease. Subsequent systemic therapies were similar across arms; 39 (24%) pts received ipilimumab, 17 (10%) received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies, and 21 (13%) received vemurafenib.  Conclusions: Landmark 2-year OS rate was 51% for Part C 150/2. Further follow-up is ongoing. Landmark 3-year OS rate and safety data with 12 mo additional follow-up will be presented.
