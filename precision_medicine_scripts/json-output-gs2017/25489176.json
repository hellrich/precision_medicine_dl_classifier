This led to successful evidence of using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) over the standard platinum doublet based chemotherapy as the first line treatment in the metastatic setting.The rearrangements of fusion protein EML4-ALK in NSCLC lead to the use of crizotinib for this class of tumors. Preclinical and Phase 1 clinical studies show that ceritinib is more effective against both crizotinib sensitive and resistant tumors. Although robust responses to crizotinib are observed in NSCLC harboring ALK mutations, majority of tumors eventually become resistant, posing a major challenge in treatment course. Thus, there is a need for the identification and development of second-generation of ALK inhibitors. Computer aided molecular docking data show Tivozanib and Lapatinib bind EML4-ALK with high score. Tivozanib is in clinical trials for renal cell cancer and Lapatinib is a known dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor effective in breast cancer patients with HER2 over-expression. Additional data on these compounds for use in EML4-ALK positive NSCLC will provide evidence for use in patients treated with crizotinib. Data shows the importance of computer aided molecular docking in developing candidates with improved activity for further consideration in vitro and in vivo validation.
