Wildtype IDH1 (wtIDH1) catalyzes the conversion of isocitrate to -ketoglutarate (KG), while tumor-associated mutant IDH1 (mIDH1) catalyzes a rogue reaction: the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) from KG. 2-HG therefore represents an oncometabolite that is believed to play a role in cancer by interfering with KG-dependent enzymes, which in turn causes hypermethylation of histones/DNA and a block of normal cellular differentiation. Mutant IDH1 is a driver oncogene and the inhibition of this altered enzyme will decrease the growth of mIDH1 dependent tumors.We report for the first time the preclinical profile and structure of BAY 1436032, a novel selective mIDH1 inhibitor. An optimization program based on a high throughput screening resulted in the identification of the clinical candidate BAY 1436032 for the treatment of mIDH1 dependent cancer. BAY 1436032 is a double-digit nanomolar and selective pan-inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of various IDH1-R132X mutants in vitro and displayed potent inhibition of 2-HG release (nanomolar range) in patient derived and engineered cell lines expressing different IDH1 mutants. In line with the proposed mode of action, a concentration-dependent lowering of 2-HG was observed in vitro accompanied by differentiation and maturation of mIDH1 tumor cells. Furthermore, BAY 1436032 showed a favourable selectivity profile against wtIDH1/2 and a large panel of off-targets in vitro.To the best of our knowledge we were able to show for the first time single agent in vivo efficacy in mIDH1 patient derived glioma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma solid tumor models with this clinical candidate along with monitoring of intratumoral 2-HG levels as a predictive biomarker. The BBB penetration profile of BAY 1436032 is further supported by preclinical data on in vivo brain-plasma ratios.In conclusion, our data provide in vitro and in vivo proof of concept for BAY 1436032 as a potent and highly selective inhibitor of mutant forms of IDH1. The start of a Phase I study with BAY 1436032 is currently in preparation to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor and pharmacodynamic biomarker responses in patients with solid tumors.","title":"BAY 1436032: A highly selective, potent and orally available inhibitor of mutant forms of IDH1","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-2645"}
