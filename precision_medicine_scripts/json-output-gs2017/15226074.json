The tumor has an accelerated growth during the pregnancy and may enlarge or become symptomatic during this period. This relationship makes management of patients with this tumor quite challenging.\nWe describe a case of a rapidly deteriorating 35-year-old woman harboring an extensive tuberculum sellae meningioma who underwent craniotomy during the 24th week of pregnancy because of rapid deterioration. The surgical procedure and postoperative period were relatively uneventful.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of surgical management of a meningioma in a patient carrying a twin pregnancy (one missed abortus). When indicated, craniotomy is a safe and effective treatment option for huge frontobasal tumors during the second trimester of pregnancy.","title":"Surgical management of tuberculum sellae meningioma in a patient with a twin pregnancy: case report.","pubmedId":"15226074"}
