Many sarcomas are known to have such fusions, and the demonstration of the fusion transcripts in tumor tissue is of great value in specific diagnosis of synovial sarcoma (SYT-SSX), Ewing sarcoma (EWS-Fli1), clear cell sarcoma (EWS-ATF1), myxoid liposarcoma (FUS-CHOP), and other sarcomas. These translocations are believed to be disease-specific and pathogenetic forces, despite occasional observations to the contrary. Demonstration of SYT-SSX and EWS-ATF1 fusion assists in the diagnosis of synovial and clear cell sarcomas in unusual locations, such as the gastrointestinal tract, where these tumors occur with low frequency. Demonstration of sarcoma translocations and their fusion by different assays is well established; use of in situ hybridization is limited by availability of specific probes. In two exceptional instances, the same translocation and gene fusion occurs in two unrelated diseases: ETV6-NTRK fusion in infantile fibrosarcoma and secretory carcinoma of the breast, and ALK-TPM3 fusion in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor and large cell anaplastic lymphoma. Thus, the target cell of the genetic change is an important factor to define the resulting disease. Activating mutations in two related receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), KIT, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) is central to the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), and countering the mutational activation by specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as Imatinib mesylate, is now standard treatment for metastatic GISTs. KIT exon 11 mutations (in frame deletions, point mutations, and duplications) occur in GISTs of all locations, whereas a characteristic exon 9 insertion-duplication AY502-503 is nearly specific for intestinal vs gastric tumors. In contrast, PDGFRA mutations are nearly specific for gastric GISTs, especially those with epithelioid morphology. Mutation type influences therapy responsiveness, but fortunately very few GISTs carry primarily Imatinib-resistant mutations. Secondary drug resistance acquired during Imatinib treatment based on new, Imatinib-resistant mutations is a major problem limiting treatment success. Loss of NF2 tumor suppressor gene in a biallelic fashion is believed to be central in the pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) associated and sporadic schwannomas and meningiomas. The mechanism includes nonsense or missense mutation in NF2 gene, and loss of the other NF2 allele as a part of losses in chromosome 22q. Schwannoma types may differ in their pathogenesis: gastrointestinal schwannomas lack NF2 changes suggesting a different pathogenesis. Intraneural and sclerosing perineuriomas display similar NF2 gene alterations as seen in meningioma, indicating a similar pathogenesis and molecular homology. Specific viral sequences of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) are diagnostic markers for Kaposi sarcoma (KS), and are absent in angiosarcoma. Despite discovery on simian virus SV40 sequences in mesothelioma as a possible pathogenetic factor, recent studies suggest that the presence of these sequences may be artifactual and based on common presence of some SV40 sequences as PCR contaminants.","title":"From morphological to molecular diagnosis of soft tissue tumors.","pubmedId":"17163160"}
