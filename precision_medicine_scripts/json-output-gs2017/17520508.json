Small-cell lung cancer is a very aggressive rapid growing tumour type treated primarily with chemotherapy and, in the minority of patients with limited disease, with radiotherapy. Non-small cell lung cancer is treated in a multidisciplinary way with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy depending on stage. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for early stage non-small cell lung cancer patients. Adjuvant therapy has become state of the art in stage II and IIIA patients and must be considered in stage IB. Stage III patients should be treated in a multimodal way with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and, if possible, with surgery. Treatment for every stage III patient should be discussed in a multidisciplinary team. Stage IV patients in good performance status will benefit from a combination chemotherapy, preferably platinum-based. Second line therapy has become standard and targeted therapies are under evaluation and are common in second line chemotherapy.","title":"[Multimodal therapy of small cell and non-small cell lung carcinoma].","pubmedId":"17520508"}
