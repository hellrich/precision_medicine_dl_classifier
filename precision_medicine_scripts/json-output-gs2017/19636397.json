Their coexistence has not been previously reported in the literature. We describe a 65-year old female who presented with extensive ileocecal mantle cell lymphoma, which extended to the appendix. The appendix was involved by mantle cell lymphoma and an incidental coexistent GIST was noted in the appendiceal wall. The GIST was CD117 positive but did not harbor mutations in the c-kit and PDGFR genes. In addition, it was unusual in showing S-100 immunoreactivity and ultrastructural evidence of autonomic nerve differentiation. This is the first description of the association of a GIST with autonomic nerve differentiation coexisting with mantle cell lymphoma in the appendix.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor with autonomic nerve differentiation and coexistent mantle cell lymphoma involving the appendix.","pubmedId":"19636397"}
