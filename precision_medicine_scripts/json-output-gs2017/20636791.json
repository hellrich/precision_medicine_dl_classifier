The aim was to study the expression of PTEN and phosphorylated (p)-mTOR in familial and sporadic invasive breast carcinomas and their relation to clinicopathological features, molecular indices (Wnt1) and patients\u0027 survival.\nPTEN and p-mTOR were detected immunohistochemically in 215 sections of invasive breast carcinomas (112 with a familial history of breast cancer). Image analysis was used and univariate and multivariate analyses employed for statistical evaluation of results. PTEN was detected in the nucleus (73.5%) and p-mTOR in the cytoplasm (44.2%) of cancer cells. Loss of PTEN protein was more frequently detected in women with a familial history of breast cancer (72%) (P \u003c 0.0001), while its expression was negatively correlated with Wnt1, in total (P \u003d 0.049). p-mTOR showed a positive association with lymph node status (P \u003d 0.010) and was found to have a negative impact on patients\u0027 overall survival (P \u003d 0.016).\nLoss of PTEN protein expression appears to occur more frequently in women with a family history of breast cancer, whereas activation of mTOR protein seems to be related to a more aggressive phenotype.","title":"Immunohistochemical study of PTEN and phosphorylated mTOR proteins in familial and sporadic invasive breast carcinomas.","pubmedId":"20636791"}
