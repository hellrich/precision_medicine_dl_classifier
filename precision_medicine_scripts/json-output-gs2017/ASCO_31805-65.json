{"publicationTypes":["2009 ASCO Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Background: Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis occurs in approximately 5% of patients with cancer. The most common cancers involving the leptomeninges are breast and lung cancer. However, gastric adenocarcinoma has been rarely reported with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC). Methods: We analyzed 54 cases of cytological confirmed gastric LMC at 4 institutions from 1994 to 2007. Results: Male to female ratio was 1.5:1. Median age of these patients was 49 years. The majority of patients had advanced disease at the initial diagnosis of gastric cancer. The clinical or pathologic TNM stages of the primary gastric cancer were IV in 38 patients (70%). The median interval from the diagnosis of the primary malignancy to the diagnosis of LMC was 6.3 months (range, 0 - 73.1 months). Of the initial endoscopic finding available 45 patients, Bormann type III and IV were 23 (51%) and 15 (33%) patients, respectively. Headache (85%) and nausea/vomiting (58%) were most common presenting symptoms of LMC. The intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy was administered to 36 patients - mainly with methotraxate alone (59%) or combination with ara- C/hydrocortisone (41%). Median IT treatment number was 7 (range, 1-18). Concomitant radiotherapy or chemotherapy was done in 25 patients and 10 patients, respectively. 17 patients (46%) were achieved cytological negative conversion. Median OS duration from diagnosis of LMC was 6.7 weeks (95% CI; 4.3-9.1 weeks). Clinically, initial advanced stage was predictive value of poor prognosis (P\u003d0.009). But, Cytology negative conversion was predictive value of relatively longer survival duration (P\u003d0.005). And, not only IT chemotherapy but also intravenous chemotherapy had been shown improvement of survival duration (P\u003d0.010, P\u003d0.005, respectively). Conclusions: Although gastric LMC has dismal prognosis, IT and IV chemotherapy could be help to extend survival duration of gastric LMC.","title":"Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis of gastric cancer: Multicenter retrospective analysis of 54 cases.","pubmedId":"ASCO_31805-65"}
