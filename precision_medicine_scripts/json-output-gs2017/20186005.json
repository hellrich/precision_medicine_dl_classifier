Usually, mutations in the codons 600 or 601 lead to constitutive activity in the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and, recently, the BRAF deletion was described as a relevant risk factor for loco-regional PTC lymph node metastasis. For these reasons, BRAF mutations may be considered a key genetic factor for the metastatic progression of PTC and also for other tumors such as melanoma and colon cancer and a new BRAF-specific therapeutic strategy was already suggested. In this report we describe the development of a rapid qualitative fluorescent real-time polymerase chain reaction assay designed for the detection of BRAF deletion using 2 specific molecular beacons. The assay is able to detect in a single tube the homozygous as well the heterozygous genotypes. The procedure combines the great sensitivity of the polymerase chain reaction, the specificity provided by allele-specific molecular beacons, and the throughput of a multicolor fluorescence detection procedure. This technique, together with an earlier described real-time test specific for V600E and K601E will be useful for research and molecular diagnostic laboratories involved in the study of BRAF-related neoplasia.","title":"Rapid multiplex real-time PCR by molecular beacons for different BRAF allele detection in papillary thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"20186005"}
