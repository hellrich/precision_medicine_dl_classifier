For the injuries in the latent phase, the treatment was administered to promote the vital energy and nourish Yin, and also to moisten the lung and relieve the coughing. Management of acute injuries included clearing away heat and toxic materials, releasing inhibited lung energy and dissipating phlegm. Treatment of promoting the vital energy and blood circulation, improving inspiration and invigorating the kidney was exercised for injuries in progressive phase.\nBoth the physicians practicing traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine found it easier to determine the optimal timing for instituting the treatments after the staging of the injuries. It was observed that complementary treatment with traditional Chinese medicine resulted in reduction of the incidence of acute radiation-induced pneumonia, esophagitis, leucopenia, recurrence and metastasis, and the patients had better quality of life with good appetite, sleeping and spirit.\nThis treatment is easy and practical, and also incorporates the Western medicine to the principles of instituting different treatments in accordance with different diagnoses in traditional Chinese medicine.","title":"[Prevention and therapy of radiation-induced pulmonary injury with traditional Chinese medicine].","pubmedId":"13129734"}
