However, leiomyosarcomatous differentiation is an extremely rare occurrence in WDL and DL. We report a case of leiomyosarcomatous differentiation in a 77-year-old man. The patient presented with a painless right scrotal mass. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large mass along the right spermatic cord. The resected mass, measuring 17.5 × 12 × 5 cm, was composed of a high-grade pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcomatous component with necrosis. Atypical smooth muscle differentiation was also detected. Additional tumor sampling revealed the presence of a WDL component. Immunohistochemical analysis of the pleomorphic sarcomatous component showed positive staining for MDM2 and CDK4, and negative staining for alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA) and desmin. The smooth muscle component was positive for αSMA and desmin, and negative for MDM2 and CDK4. Extension from primary retroperitoneal sarcoma was not proved. We diagnosed of DL with leiomyosarcomatous differentiation.\nThe virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1484291498104021.","title":"Paratesticular dedifferentiated liposarcoma with leiomyosarcomatous differentiation: a case report with a review of literature.","pubmedId":"23971887"}
