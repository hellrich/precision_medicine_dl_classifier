Alterations of the p53 and ras genes are also common features in the molecular biology of lung carcinoma, and the authors of this article have reported previously on the prognostic significance of both of them. In the present study, the authors evaluated the prognostic significance of the loss of Rb protein expression alone, then performed a combined analysis of Rb protein and ras p21 status (Rb/ras) as well as an analysis of Rb and p53 protein status (Rb/p53) in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nNinety-one patients with NSCLC underwent potentially curative resection between 1977 and 1988, 65 of whom received postoperative combination chemotherapy. Tumor specimens were analyzed for Rb protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the association between Rb protein expression and survival.\nNineteen (21%) of the 91 NSCLCs showed negative Rb protein expression. Positive or negative Rb protein expression (Rb+ or Rb-) as an individual factor was not statistically correlated with survival or prognosis in this cohort of NSCLC patients, although a tendency among Rb- patients to do worse was observed. The authors then combined the Rb protein status with previously studied results of ras p21 and p53 protein expression in the same tumor specimens, and compared the prognosis between the individuals with theoretically the best pattern of gene expression in their tumors and those with theoretically the worst pattern of expression, i.e., Rb+/ras- versus Rb-/ras+ and Rb+/p53- versus Rb-/p53+. In patients with adenocarcinoma, those with Rb-/ras+ tumors survived for a significantly shorter period after surgery (13% 5-year survival) than those with Rb+/ras- tumors (82% 5-year survival) (P \u003d 0.01). Similarly, patients with Rb-/p53+ tumors survived for a significantly shorter period (20% 5-year survival) compared with those who had Rb+/p53- tumors (73% 5-year survival) (P \u003d 0.008). Rb/ras status was a significant prognostic factor (P \u003d 0.02 by univariate analysis, P \u003d 0.048 by multivariate analysis), and Rb/p53 status tended to be significant as a prognostic factor (P \u003d 0.04 by univariate analysis, P \u003d 0.08 by multivariate analysis). In patients with squamous cell carcinoma, neither Rb/ras nor Rb/p53 status was a significant prognostic factor in this cohort.\nThese results suggest that combined immunohistochemical analyses of Rb and ras p21 proteins and of Rb and p53 proteins may indicate their potentially synergistic effects on survival and prognosis. These analyses may also be useful for stratifying patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung into different prognostic groups and identifying populations with different risks of recurrence. Larger prospective studies with Stage I NSCLC patients are necessary to confirm the current findings.","title":"Altered retinoblastoma protein expression in nonsmall cell lung cancer: its synergistic effects with altered ras and p53 protein status on prognosis.","pubmedId":"9083154"}
