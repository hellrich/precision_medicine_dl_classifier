Ten cases were enrolled, and the time from initial pancreatectomy to recurrence, location of recurrence, and outcome after surgical treatment for recurrence was evaluated. The time to recurrence was more than 1 year in 4 cases, and the locations of recurrence in these cases were the remnant pancreas and lung in 3 and 1 patients, respectively. Among these 4 cases, a second recurrence was observed in only 1 case, and survival after surgical treatment of the first recurrent site was more than 3 years in the other 3 cases. For the remaining 6 cases, the time to recurrence was less than 1 year and the recurrences were located in the abdomen but not in the remnant pancreas. A second recurrence was observed in all cases, and the survival time was less than 2 years in 4 out of 6 cases. Based on the results of this study, recurrence in the remnant pancreas and lung after curative resection for pancreatic ductal cancer could be a potential indication for surgical treatment.","title":"[An Evaluation of Outcome of Surgical Treatment for Recurrence after Curative Pancreatectomy for Pancreatic Ductal Cancer].","pubmedId":"26805061"}
