Women with cervical cancer diagnosed at \u003c20 to 24 weeks of gestation are typically treated immediately, whereas patients diagnosed later in pregnancy often defer treatment until after delivery. Women with early stage cervical cancer can be treated with either surgery or radiation, whereas those with advanced-stage disease are usually treated with radiation, often in combination with chemotherapy.","title":"Cervical neoplasia.","pubmedId":"22031243"}
