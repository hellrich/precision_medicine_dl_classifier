Previous miRNA microarray analysis illustrated that miR-320c is down-regulated in various cancers. However, the roles of miR-320c in human bladder cancer have not been well elucidated. Therefore, this study was performed to investigate the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of miR-320c in human bladder cancer cell lines, discussing whether it could be a therapeutic biomarker of bladder cancer in the future.\nTwo human bladder cancer cell lines and samples from thirteen patients with bladder cancer were analyzed for the expression of miR-320c by quantitative RT-PCR. Over-expression of miR-320c was established by transfecting mimics into T24 and UM-UC-3. Cell proliferation and cell cycle were assessed by cell viability assay, flow cytometry and colony formation assay. Cell motility ability was evaluated by transwell assay. The target gene of miR-320c was determined by luciferase assay, quantitative RT-PCR and western blot. The regulation of cell cycle and mobility by miR-320c was analyzed by western blot.\nWe observed that miR-320c was down-regulated in human bladder cancer tissues and bladder cancer cell lines T24 and UM-UC-3. Over-expression of miR-320c could induce G1 phase arrest in UM-UC-3 and T24 cells, and subsequently inhibited cell growth. We also indentified miR-320c could impair UM-UC-3 and T24 cell motility. In addition, we identified CDK6, a cell cycle regulator, as a novel target of miR-320c. Moreover, we demonstrated miR-320c could induce bladder cancer cell cycle arrest and mobility via regulating CDK6. We also observed that inhibition of miR-320c or restoration of CDK6 in miR-320c-over-expressed bladder cancer cells partly reversed the suppressive effects of miR-320c.\nmiR-320c could inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells via regulating CDK6. Our study revealed that miR-320c could be a therapeutic biomarker of bladder cancer in the future.","title":"MicroRNA-320c inhibits tumorous behaviors of bladder cancer by targeting Cyclin-dependent kinase 6.","pubmedId":"25178497"}
