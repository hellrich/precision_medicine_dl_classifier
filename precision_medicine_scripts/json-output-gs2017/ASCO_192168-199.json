However, almost all patients ultimately develop PD while receiving TKI treatment. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is promising as a minimally-invasive liquid biopsy for comprehensive analysis of molecular abnormalities. Methods: A total of 254 advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with signs of EGFR-TKI resistance were enrolled in the study. ctDNA was analyzed using next-generation sequencing based ER-Seq method, which enables simultaneously assess single-nucleotide variants, insertions/deletions, rearrangements, and somatic copy-number alterations across 59 genes. Results: ctDNA profiling was possible for all patients, 172 patients had  1 ctDNA alteration(s). Median number of plasma somatic mutations was 2, predominantly located in EGFR and TP53, with MET, ERBB2 and PIK3CA followed. Of that, 30.6% of mutations detected in ctDNA were at a frequency below 1%. In exploring the mechanisms of TKI-resistance, we found TKI-sensitizing mutations were not detected in plasma of 138 patients (54.3%). Known mechanisms such as EGFR T790M/C797S mutation, activating mutations of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, amplification of MET, activating mutation / amplification of ERBB2, activating mutation of KRAS, BRAF or mutations in EGFR EX20 other than T790M/C797S were identified in 59, 16, 8, 7, 3, 2, and 2 patients respectively. T790M/C797S was detected in 50.8% of patients with plasma positive for TKI-sensitizing mutations. Of note, C797S was only detected in patients treated with AZD9291. EGFR amplification were identified in 15 patients, though whether it would result in TKI-resistance was still controversial. Co-occurrence of resistance mechanisms were observed in 22 patients including 13 patients without TKI-sensitizing mutations. Conclusions: There was a high frequency of inter and intra-patient heterogeneity of resistance mechanisms after EGFR TKI therapy. ctDNA can be used as a liquid biopsy to facilitate the broad exploration of potential resistance mechanisms.","title":"Circulating tumor DNA profiling to reveal heterogeneity of EGFR-TKI resistance mechanisms in lung adenocarcinoma patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_192168-199"}
