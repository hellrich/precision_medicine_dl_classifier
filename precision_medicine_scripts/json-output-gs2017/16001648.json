We report here a case of ampullary carcinoma accompanied with protein-losing gastroenteropathy due to diffuse varioliform gastritis. A 39-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital because of general fatigue and generalized edema. Her total protein level was 3.1g/dL, with an albumin level of 1.4g/dL, and hemoglobin level of 6.9g/dL. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examination showed diffuse varioliform gastritis and carcinoma of the papilla of Vater. A diagnosis of protein-losing gastropathy was made based on the results of scintigraphy using technetium 99m-labeled human albumin. Continuous bleeding from ampullary carcinoma caused anemia and deteriorated hypoproteinemia. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed for ampullary carcinoma prior to Helicobacter pylori eradication. The tumor was a papillary adenocarcinoma, which had invaded the lamina muscularis propria over the sphincter of Oddi; the resected stomach revealed typical hyperplastic lymphocytic gastritis. H. pylori were detected on microscopic analysis. Scintigraphy after surgery showed no accumulation of the tracer in the bowel. Anemia, hypoalbuminemia and diffuse varioliform gastritis are improved 6 months after surgery and H. pylori eradication, and the patient is currently free from disease.","title":"Ampullary carcinoma associated with protein-losing gastropathy due to diffuse varioliform gastritis.","pubmedId":"16001648"}
