The availability of multiplexed assays to detect mutations permits the identification of multiple driver mutations from tumors at diagnosis.  The number of molecular lesions and new agents to target them continues to grow. To exploit this, we created the LCMC to determine 10 driver mutations in tumors from 1,000 patients and to give the results to clinicians for care and entry onto targeted therapeutic trials based on these findings. Methods: The 14 member LCMC is prospectively enrolling patients to test tumors from patients with lung adenocarcinoma in CLIA laboratories for KRAS, EGFR, HER2, BRAF, PIK3CA, AKT1, MEK1, and NRAS using standard multiplexed assays and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for ALK rearrangements and MET amplifications.  All are stage IIIB/IV, PS 0-2, have available tissue, and signed consent. Results: 830 patients have been registered with 50 enrolling monthly. We detected a driver mutation in 60% (252/422, 95% CI 55 to 65%) of tumors thus far. Mutations found:  KRAS 107 (25%, 95% CI 21 to 30%), EGFR 98 (23%, 95% CI 19 to 27%), ALK rearrangements 14 (6%, 95% CI 4 to11%), BRAF 12 (3%, 95% CI 1 to 5%), PIK3CA 11 (3%, 95% CI 1 to 5%), MET amplifications 4 (2%, 95% CI 0.5 to 5%), HER2 3, (1%, 95% CI 0.1 to 2%), MEK1 2 (0.4%, 95% CI 0.1 to 2%), NRAS 1 (0.2%, 95% CI 0.01 to 1%), AKT1 0 (0%, 95% CI 0 to 1%).  95% of molecular lesions were mutually exclusive. Conclusions: We detected an actionable driver mutation in 60% of tumors from prospectively studied patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Results of EGFR mutation testing are given to treating physicians to select erlotinib as initial treatment per NCCN and ASCO guidelines. Patients with other driver mutations are offered participation in LCMC-linked trials of agents targeting the mutation identified, e.g. crizotinib with EML4-ALK.  At half of LCMC sites, multiplexed testing for all mutations is now routine practice in their pathology departments.
