In order to determine whether MTS-1 sequences are deleted or mutated in cell lines derived from these cancers, we performed PCR amplification of MTS-1 exons 1 and 2. In this fashion, we found that 67% of esophagus squamous cancer cell lines have deletions of both exons 1 and 2, and 50% of pancreatic cancer cell lines have similar deletions. Furthermore, an additional 30% of pancreatic cancer cell lines harbored point mutations or microdeletions based on DNA sequencing. MTS-1 encodes p16, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4) which complexes with cyclin D1. Our data suggest that MTS-1 deletions and mutations may play an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of esophagus squamous cell and pancreatic cancers.","title":"MTS-1 (CDKN2) tumor suppressor gene deletions are a frequent event in esophagus squamous cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines.","pubmedId":"7845688"}
