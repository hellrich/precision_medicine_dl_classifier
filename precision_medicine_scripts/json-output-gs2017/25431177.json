Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the MDM2 intronic promoter (P2) have been found to exert biological function. The G-allele of SNP309T\u003eG; rs2279744 increases MDM2 transcription and has been linked to increased cancer risk. In contrast, the less frequent SNP285G\u003eC; rs117039649, which is in complete linkage disequilibrium with SNP309 (generating a SNP285C/309G variant haplotype), has been related to reduced MDM2 transcription and to reduced risk of breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer. In this large population-based case-control study, we genotyped SNP309 and SNP285 in 10,830 individuals, including cases with cancer of the breast (n\u003d1,717), colon (n\u003d1,532), lung (n\u003d1,331) and prostate (n\u003d2,501), as well as 3,749 non-cancer controls. We found a slightly reduced risk for lung cancer among individuals harboring the SNP309TG/GG genotypes compared to the SNP309TT genotype (OR\u003d 0.86; CI \u003d 0.67-0.98), but this association was restricted to women (OR \u003d 0.77; CI \u003d 0.63-0.95) and was not present among men (OR \u003d 0.91; CI \u003d 0.77-1.08). Consistent with previous findings, we found a reduced risk for breast cancer among individuals carrying the SNP285GC/309GG genotype versus the SNP285GG/309GG genotype (OR \u003d 0.55; CI \u003d 0.33-0.93). In conclusion, our data support the hypothesis that the effects of both SNP285 and SNP309 status are tissue dependent.","title":"Influence of MDM2 SNP309 and SNP285 status on the risk of cancer in the breast, prostate, lung and colon.","pubmedId":"25431177"}
