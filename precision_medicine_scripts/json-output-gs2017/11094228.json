Compared with the unaffected right hemicervix, only the tumor-involved glands of the atretic left hemicervix contained ciliated tuboendometrial cells. Four and a half years after radical hysterectomy and pelvic radiation, she showed no evidence of recurrence.\nIn contrast to current opinion, communicating uteri type 7 are associated with ipsilateral renal agenesis. Our histologic findings support the hypothesis that tuboendometrial cells are the cells of origin for cervical clear-cell adenocarcinoma.","title":"Clear cell adenocarcinoma of the cervix associated with a rare genitourinary malformation.","pubmedId":"11094228"}
