The research of factors related to oncogenesis, tumor infiltration and metastasis is valuable. AMPK(AMP-activated protein kinase)family is a group of regulators on the cellular energy metabolism which are sensitive to the cytoplasmic change of AMP/ATP ratio. As a member of AMPK, BRSK2 is found to be expressed in human pancreatic cell line and facilitate the tumor cell survival on glucose starving. In order to examine the expression of BRSK2 in human pancreatic cancer and explore the underline clinical implication, human pancreatic tissue was examined immunohistochemically Correlation of tumor biological behavior, prognosis and BRSK2 expression was examined. Methods: Seventy nine resected tumor specimens were collected. Immunochemical staining method was used to examine the expression pattern of BRSK2 translated protein. Semi-quantitative analysis was employed to compare the expression intensity and content of BRSK2 in tumor issues, peri-tumorous tissue and normal pancreatic tissue. Possible relationship of tumors differentiation, TNM stage, presence or absence of vessel and neural infiltration were explored with BRSK2 expression. The correlation of BRSK2 expression profile and patients survival was explored. Results: BRSK2 was weakly expressed in normal pancreatic tissues and peri-tumor tissues, including the islet and minor ducts. BRSK2 was strongly expressed in pancreatic cancer tissues, the expression intensity was correlated with extent of lymphatic metastasis, distant metastasis, TNM staging and neural invasion. Tumors with lymphatic metastasis, distant metastasis, neural invasion and later TNM stages showed stronger expression of BRSK2. The expression of BRSK2 in pancreatic cancer was closely correlated to the prognosis of patients, those with higher expression pattern showed bad prognosis. Conclusions: BRSK2 is up-regulated in pancreatic cancer; the expression of BRSK2 is correlated with tumor biological behavior and patient\u0027s prognosis.","title":"BRSK2 expression as a prognosis marker in pancreatic cancer patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_30168-65"}
