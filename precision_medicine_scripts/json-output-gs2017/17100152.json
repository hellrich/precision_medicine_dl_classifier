However, there is no broadly accepted concept of early bile duct cancer. We aimed to assess whether early bile duct cancer patients have characteristic clinicopathological features and a better prognosis compared with patients with advanced bile duct cancer.\nBetween June 1996 and December 2004, 614 patients were histologically confirmed with primary bile duct cancers after resection. Extrahepatic early bile duct cancers are defined as carcinoma where invasion is confined within the fibromuscular layer of the extrahepatic bile duct. Intrahepatic early bile duct cancers arising from intrahepatic large bile ducts are also defined as carcinoma confined within the fibromuscular layer. We retrospectively reviewed medical records to obtain demographic, laboratory, radiological and pathological data.\nSixty-one (10%) patients were categorised with early bile duct cancers. They were frequently detected at asymptomatic (39%) or non-icteric (84%) stages. The most common gross type was the intraductal-growing type (58%). Not otherwise specified adenocarcinoma was only 67%, whereas papillary carcinoma was 31% of cancers. No lymph node metastasis and no lymphovascular/perineural invasions were noted in 89% of patients. The 5-year survival rate for early bile duct cancer was excellent (80%).\nAlthough early bile duct cancer is not a common disease, it is not a very rare entity either. The clinicopathological features of early bile duct cancer patients differ from those of advanced bile duct cancer patients, with asymptomatic clinical presentation, different macroscopic and microscopic findings, and excellent prognosis.","title":"Clinicopathological review of 61 patients with early bile duct cancer.","pubmedId":"17100152"}
