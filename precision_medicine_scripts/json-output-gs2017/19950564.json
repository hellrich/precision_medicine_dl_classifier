All of them underwent a tru-cut biopsy combined with fine needle aspiration biopsy for the pathological diagnosis during operation.\nOf the 22 patients, 20 were finally diagnosed as having pancreatic carcinoma, while 2 having pancreatitis. The diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma was confirmed in 19 by tru-cut biopsy combined with fine needle aspiration biopsy, while other 3 cases were not confirmed as pancreatic carcinoma. Among those 3 cases, one was diagnosed as having pancreatic carcinoma with hepatic metastasis by liver nodular biopsy, one as suffering from autoimmune pancreatitis, and another case as having chronic pancreatitis confirmed by follow-up for 9 months without any changes after the operation. The accuracy of FNA, TCB and FNA combined with TCB in the diagnosis for suspected pancreatic cancer were 86.4%, 90.9%, and 95.5%, respectively. No pancreatic fistula and bleeding developed after operation.\nTru-cut biopsy is more accurate in diagnosis for the suspected pancreatic cancer than fine needle aspiration biopsy during operation. Tru-cut biopsy combined with fine needle aspiration biopsy can improve the accuracy of diagnosis, and is a safe and effective diagnostic method.","title":"[Application of tru-cut biopsy combined with fine needle aspiration biopsy in the intraoperative pathological diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma].","pubmedId":"19950564"}
