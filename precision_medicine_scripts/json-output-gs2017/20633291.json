Single- and double-mutant isoforms of Kit were evaluated for their sensitivity to motesanib or imatinib in autophosphorylation assays and in Ba/F3 cell proliferation assays.\nMotesanib inhibited Kit autophosphorylation in CHO cell lines expressing primary activating mutations in exon 9 (AYins503-504, IC50 \u003d 18 nM) and exon 11 (V560 D, IC50 \u003d 5 nM; Delta552-559, IC50 \u003d 1 nM). Motesanib also demonstrated activity against kinase domain mutations conferring imatinib resistance (V560D/V654A, IC50 \u003d 77 nM; V560D/T670I, IC50 \u003d 277 nM; Y823 D, IC50 \u003d 64 nM) but failed to inhibit the imatinib-resistant D816V mutant (IC50 \u003e 3000 nM). Motesanib suppressed the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing Kit mutants with IC50 values in good agreement with those observed in the autophosphorylation assays.\nIn conclusion, our data suggest that motesanib possesses inhibitory activity against primary Kit mutations and some imatinib-resistant secondary mutations.","title":"Motesanib inhibits Kit mutations associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"20633291"}
