Here, we describe the evolution of our previous PIM1 inhibitor 1 into PIM3 inhibitor 11 guided by use of the crystal structure of PIM1 as a surrogate to provide a basis for rational modification. Compound 11 potently inhibits PIM3 kinase activity, as well as growth of several pancreatic cancer cell lines. In a mouse xenograft model, 11 inhibited growth of human pancreatic cancer cell line PCI66 with negligible body weight loss. Thus, 11 appears to be a promising lead compound for further optimization to develop new anti-pancreatic cancer agents.
