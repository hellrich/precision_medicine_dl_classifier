Major changes in the reimbursement of primary care for the management of both hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia have occurred in the UK.\nUsing a GP database we have examined the proportion of subjects diagnosed and treated for hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia over time. To examine the true population rates and primary care data we compared the results of the Health survey for England in both 1998 and 2003 with the recorded data on GP computers. Despite current guidelines, many patients with hypertension and/or hypercholesterolaemia are under-treated and, even amongst those who are treated, many do not achieve their blood pressure and/or lipid targets. Although treatment rates in the UK have improved recently, particularly for lipid-lowering therapies, they remain suboptimal. AIMS To determine the prevalence and treatment of hypertension, dyslipidaemia and both together in the UK between 1998 and 2006.\nWe used The Health Improvement Network (THIN) a general practice-based database from 1998 to 2006 and we compared the 1998 and 2003 data to that taken from the Health Survey for England (HSE) in 1998 and 2003.\nThe prevalence (treatment) of hypertension was 25.3% (11.4%) in 1998, 27.8% (15.1%) in 2003 and 26.9% (16.2%) in 2006 in THIN. In HSE it was 37.3% (9.6%) in 1998 and 32.9% (13.8%) in 2003. For dyslipidaemia the figures were 8.6% (1.9%), 18.5% (6.5%) and 24.4% (9.8%) for THIN and 67.8% (2.3%) and 74.9% (7.0%) for HSE. Concurrent hypertension and dyslipidaemia in THIN increased from 5.5% (1.1%) in 1998 to 13.5% (4.5%) in 2003 and 17.4% (7.1%) in 2006. The prevalence of both conditions was 30.6% (0.7%) in HSE in 1998 and 28.7% (3.1%) in 2003.\nThere has been a progressive improvement in the detection and treatment of hypertension, dyslipidaemia and both conditions together between 1998 and 2006. However, much still needs to be done to improve the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and concurrent hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia in the United Kingdom.","title":"Prevalence and treatment of isolated and concurrent hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia in the United Kingdom.","pubmedId":"18279464"}
