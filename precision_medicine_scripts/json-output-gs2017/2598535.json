Among 322 patients with malignant tumor, 7 patients with primary brain tumor and 21 patients with metastatic brain tumors were found. The over-all frequency of metastases to the brain was 5.8%. This frequency of brain metastasis in the elderly was lower than those of the previous literature which have varied from 9 to 35%. The patients\u0027 ages with metastatic brain tumor ranged from 65 to 88 years with a median age of 77.5 years. The primary tumor sites of metastatic brain tumors were limited to 5 kinds of organs. These metastases were found in 27.3% of 11 patients with breast cancer, 17.5% of 80 patients with lung cancer, 6.7% of 15 patients with bile duct system cancer, 5.0% of 20 patients with pancreatic cancer, and 2.0% of 91 patients with gastric cancer. There was no brain metastasis in the other kinds of carcinoma. Among 21 metastatic brain tumors, there were 14 patients with lung cancer, 3 patients with breast cancer, 2 patients with gastric cancer, 1 patient with cholangiocarcinoma, and 1 patient with pancreatic cancer. In this series, the frequency of single and multiple metastases were 13 and 8 cases, respectively. The multiple brain metastases ranged from 2 to 6 nodules. In 21 metastatic brain tumors, there were 42 metastatic nodules in total.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","title":"[Metastatic brain tumor in the elderly].","pubmedId":"2598535"}
