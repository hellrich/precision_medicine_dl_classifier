Local recurrence was seen in 11 patients, metastases in 3. Survival was 1 year in one case up to 18 years in another. There was a close correlation of survival and histological findings. There was also a distinct influence of primary surgical therapy on local recurrence rate. In our opinion, the extent of excision of the primary tumor is most important in the treatment of liposarcoma.","title":"[Surgical therapy of liposarcoma].","pubmedId":"6678723"}
