It remains unclear how LKB1 inactivation coordinates tumor progression with metabolic adaptation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here in Kras(G12D);Lkb1(lox/lox) (KL) mouse model, we reveal differential reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). ROS can modulate ADC-to-SCC transdifferentiation (AST). Further, pentose phosphate pathway deregulation and impaired fatty acid oxidation collectively contribute to the redox imbalance and functionally affect AST. Similar tumor and redox heterogeneity also exist in human NSCLC with LKB1 inactivation. In preclinical trials toward metabolic stress, certain KL ADC can develop drug resistance through squamous transdifferentiation. This study uncovers critical redox control of tumor plasticity that may affect therapeutic response in NSCLC.
