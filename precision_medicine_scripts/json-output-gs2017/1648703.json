Here we report the molecular cloning and sequence of a new member of the FGF receptor family, denoted flg-2, which was isolated from a human keratinocyte cDNA library. The cDNA sequence predicts an extracellular region possessing three immunoglobulin-like domains, a single transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic portion containing the tyrosine kinase domain split by a short inter-kinase segment. The amino acid sequence of flg-2 shows 68% and 64% identity with bek and flg, respectively. The most variable domain among the three genes is the amino-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain. Comparison with the chicken FGF receptor genes suggests that flg-2 is homologous to cek-2, whereas flg and bek are homologous to cek-1 and cek-3, respectively. Analysis of mRNA from various tissues shows that flg-2 is expressed predominantly in skin, brain and lung.","title":"Flg-2, a new member of the family of fibroblast growth factor receptors.","pubmedId":"1648703"}
