The oncogenic phosphatase Wip1 plays a crucial role in DNA damage response by inhibiting several cell cycle proteins, including p53. Although Wip1 gene amplification has been reported in various primary tumors, including lung cancer, its biological significance for survival of primary lung tumor patients remains unclear. We investigated the expression of Wip1 in cancer epithelial cells immunohistochemically in 84 consecutive resected cases of lung adenocarcinoma. Increased Wip1 expression was observed in 54 (64.3%) of the 84 cases. Wip1 expression was found to be correlated significantly with two clinicopathological factors: Î³-H2AX expression, and invasion to the pulmonary vein. A univariate analysis and log-rank test indicated a significant association between Wip1 expression and lower overall survival rate (P \u003d 0.019 and P \u003d 0.0099, respectively). A multivariate analysis also indicated a statistically significant association between increased Wip1 expression and lower overall survival rate (hazard ratio, 4.3; P \u003d 0.026). The Ki67 index level was higher in the Wip1-positive group than in the negative group (P \u003c 0.04, Mann-Whitney U-test). Moreover, in a subgroup analysis of only stage I patients, increased Wip1 expression was also significantly associated with a lower overall survival rate (P \u003d 0.023, log-rank test). These results indicate that the increased expression of Wip1 in cancer epithelial cells has significant value for tumor progression and the clinical prognosis of patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma.","title":"Oncogenic phosphatase Wip1 is a novel prognostic marker for lung adenocarcinoma patient survival.","pubmedId":"21281403"}
