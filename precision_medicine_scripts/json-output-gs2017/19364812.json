The objective of this study was to identify indolequinones with improved potency against pancreatic cancer and to define their mechanisms of action. Pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2, and BxPC-3 were used in in vitro assays [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) and clonogenic assays]; indolequinones displayed potent cytotoxicity against all three cell lines, and two specific classes of indolequinone were particularly potent agents. These indolequinones induced caspase-dependent apoptosis but no redox cycling or oxidative stress in MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 cells. Selected indolequinones were also screened against the NCI-60 cell line panel and were found to be particularly effective against colon, renal, and melanoma cancer cells. A potential target of these indolequinones was identified as thioredoxin reductase. Indolequinones were found to be potent inhibitors of thioredoxin reductase activity both in pancreatic cancer cells and in cell-free systems. The mechanism of action of the indolequinones was shown to involve metabolic reduction, loss of a leaving group to generate a reactive electrophile resulting in alkylation of the selenocysteine residue in the active site of thioredoxin reductase. In vivo efficacy of the indolequinones was also tested in the MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic tumor xenograft in nude mice, and lead indolequinones demonstrated high efficacy and low toxicity. Inhibition of thioredoxin reductase represents a potential novel target in pancreatic cancer and may provide a biomarker of effect of lead indolequinones in this type of cancer.","title":"Potent activity of indolequinones against human pancreatic cancer: identification of thioredoxin reductase as a potential target.","pubmedId":"19364812"}
