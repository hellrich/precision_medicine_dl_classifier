However, it is unclear whether adjuvant chemotherapy is feasible in clinical practice. The objective of this study was to analyze the efficacy and safety of adjuvant chemotherapy for small cell lung cancer patients retrospectively in clinical practice.\nFrom January 2002 to March 2012, 56 small cell lung cancer patients underwent surgery as initial therapy in our institute. Of these, 26 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. The clinical data of patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy were retrospectively analyzed.\nThe chemotherapy regimens were cisplatin and irinotecan in 16 patients, cisplatin and etoposide in 1 and carboplatin and etoposide in 9. Median follow-up time was 44.8 months. Nineteen (73%) patients received the full course of chemotherapy. Median recurrence-free survival was 21.4 months. Median survival time was not reached. There was no treatment-related death.\nAdjuvant chemotherapy may be generally safe and efficacious in selected small cell lung cancer patients.","title":"Adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with completely resected small cell lung cancer: a retrospective analysis of 26 consecutive cases.","pubmedId":"25097183"}
