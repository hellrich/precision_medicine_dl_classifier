To address this issue, the descending thoracic aorta was banded for 4 and 8 weeks in adult guinea pigs, and the changes in isovolumic LV mechanics, SR Ca2+ transport, and SR protein levels were determined and compared with age-matched sham-operated control animals. A subgroup of the 8-week banded animals manifested the congestive heart failure phenotype with diminished developed LV pressure normalized by LV mass, reduced rates of LV pressure development and relaxation, and markedly increased lung weight-to-body weight ratios. The cardiac mechanical and morphometric changes were associated with depressed protein levels of the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase (85% of the control) and phospholamban (65% of the control) assessed by quantitative immunoblotting. Resultant rates of SR Ca2+ uptake (Vmax) and the affinity of SR Ca(2+)-ATPase for Ca2+ (EC50) were significantly depressed [32 +/- 6 nmol Ca2+.min-1.mg-1 and 0.59 +/- 0.12 (mumol/L)/L, respectively] compared with the 8-week sham-operated control animals [40 +/- 1 nmol Ca2+.min-1.mg-1 and 0.40 +/- 0.05 (mumol/L)/L, respectively]. We conclude that this model of pressure overload-induced cardiac failure is associated with (1) diminished LV force development, rates of pressure development, and decay; (2) depressed protein expression of the Ca(2+)-cycling proteins SR Ca(2+)-ATPase and phospholamban; and (3) decreased Vmax and affinity of the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase for Ca2+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","title":"Differential changes in cardiac phospholamban and sarcoplasmic reticular Ca(2+)-ATPase protein levels.
