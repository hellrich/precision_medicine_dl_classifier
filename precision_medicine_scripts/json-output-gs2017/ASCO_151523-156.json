The introduction of NGS technologies in clinical investigation may enhance pt inclusion through the discovery of a wider set of mutations (mt) in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.  Methods:  From March/2012 to December/2014 411 pts with chemorefractory mCRC underwent genetic tumor profiling as part of the molecular enhancement strategy in our early drug development program. Base extension chemistry followed by mass detection (MassARRAY, Sequenom) (SQ) was used including 268 frequent hotspots in 25 oncogenes with a sensitivity of 10% of mutant alleles. Since June/2014, Amplicon sequencing (NGS) was implemented assessing mt in 59 oncogenes and tumor suppressors with a sensitivity of 3% mutant alleles.  Results:  From March/2012 to Jun/2014 324 pts were screened using SQ, 261 mt were detected: 0.80 mt per patient. A total of 117 pts (36%) resulted wild-type (wt) after the test. Frequency of mt were: 48.77% KRAS, 16.67% PI3KCA, 7.41% NRAS, 7.41% BRAF, along with minor events: 2 mt in AKT1 and 1 mt in PDGFRA, GNAS and ERBB2 allowing a total of 89 inclusions on matched targeted therapies (27.47% inclusion rate per total samples). From Jun/2014 to Dec/2014 78 pts were screened with NGS, 5 pts (6%) were wt. A total of 160 mt were detected (1.83 mt per patient): 44.83% KRAS, 4.6% NRAS, 51.72% TP53, 43.68% APC, 5.75% BRAF, 5% PI3KCA, 4.6% SMAD4, 3.45% PTEN and 1mt in GNAS, AKT2, MET, STK11, FBXW7, JAK3, FGFR1, NOTCH1, MSH6, RNF43, RET and NF2 providing 21 inclusions to treatment with targeted therapy (26.4% inclusions per total samples).  Conclusions:  Our results show that NGS techniques allow the identification of a wider spectrum of mts per patient compared to prior generation genomic tests, although this has failed to be translated yet into higher inclusion rates in clinical trials with targeted agents. An enhanced discovery of mutations in tumor suppressor genes, thus far out of therapeutic reach and other factors like recent implementation of NGS and the increasing search for more specific molecular populations can contribute to this fact.","title":"Measuring the impact of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technique implementation in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) drug development program.","pubmedId":"ASCO_151523-156"}
