While the addition of cisplatin to gemcitabine did not produce survival benefit compared to single-agent gemcitabine in prospective trials it is postulated that the addition of DNA cross-linking agent such as cisplatin to standard gemcitabine chemotherapy should be considered in known BRCA mutation carriers. We report a case of pancreatic adenocarcinoma arising in a 60-year-old carrier of a rare BRCA2 (1153insertionT) germline mutation. The patient received gemcitabine without any response and actually progression of the disease had occurred. Therefore cisplatin was added in combination with gemcitabine. A dramatic complete response to therapy was encountered with no evidence of disease in both CT scans and markers (CA19-9). In conclusion, in patients with known BRCA mutation associated pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the addition of a DNA cross-linking agent such as cisplatin should be considered. Physicians should consider BRCA mutation testing when the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is established, especially when the patient belongs to an ethnic group where founder mutations exist, and/or there is strong personal or family history of cancer. This may be applied also to other metastatic tumors diagnosed in BRCA1/2 carriers.","title":"Complete remission, in BRCA2 mutation carrier with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, treated with cisplatin based therapy.","pubmedId":"21613821"}
