The incidence of congestive heart failure is higher in diabetic patients, although the reasons for this increased rate are debated (higher incidence and severity of coronary heart disease and arterial hypertension, or a true diabetic cardiomyopathy). The treatment of heart failure in diabetic patients does not differ from that of non-diabetic patients, although recent studies of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers offer interesting new perspectives.","title":"[Prevention and treatment of congestive heart failure in diabetic patients].","pubmedId":"12383394"}
