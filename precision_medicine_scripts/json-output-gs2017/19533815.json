Diagnosis of ampullary carcinoma was confirmed histologically. Thirty-five patients underwent preoperative biliary drainage (PBD group), and 47 were not drained (non-PBD group). The mode of biliary drainage was endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (n \u003d 33) or percutaneous biliary drainage (n \u003d 2). The following parameters were analyzed: wound infection, intra-abdominal abscess, intra-abdominal or gastrointestinal bleeding, septicemia, biliary or pancreatic leakage, pancreatitis, gastroparesis, and re-operation rate. Mortality was assessed at 30 d (hospital mortality) and also long-term. The statistical endpoint of this study was patient survival after surgery.\nThe groups were well matched for demographic criteria, clinical presentation and operative characteristics, except for lower hemoglobin in the non-PBD group (10.9 +/- 1.6 vs 11.8 +/- 1.6 in the PBD group). Of the parameters assessing postoperative morbidity, incidence of wound infection was significantly less in the PBD than the non-PBD group [1 (2.9%) vs 12 (25.5%)]. However, the rest of the parameters did not differ significantly between the groups, i.e. sepsis [10 (28.6%) vs 14 (29.8%)], intra-abdominal bleeding [1 (2.9%) vs 5 (10.6%)], intra-abdominal abscess [1 (2.9%) vs 8 (17%)], gastrointestinal bleeding [3 (8.6%) vs 5 (10.6%)], pancreatic leakage [2 (5.7%) vs 3 (6.4%)], biliary leakage [2 (5.7%) vs 3 (6.4%)], pancreatitis [2 (5.7%) vs 2 (4.3%)], gastroparesis [6 (17.1%) vs 10 (21.3%)], need for blood transfusion [10 (28.6%) vs 17 (36.2%)] and re-operation rate [1 (2.9%) vs 5 (10.6%)]. There was no early mortality in either group. Median survival was 44 mo (95% CI: 34.2-53.8) in the PBD group and 41 mo (95% CI: 27.7-54.3; P \u003d 0.86) in the non-PBD group.\nBiliary drainage before surgery for ampullary cancer significantly reduced postoperative wound infection. Overall mortality was not influenced by preoperative drainage.","title":"Ampullary carcinoma: effect of preoperative biliary drainage on surgical outcome.","pubmedId":"19533815"}
