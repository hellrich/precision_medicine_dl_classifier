Research began to focus on combining gemcitabine with newer drugs, such as carboplatin (Paraplatin), vinorelbine (Navelbine), the taxanes, and the camptothecins, when it became clear that these agents had potentially increased efficacy and fewer side effects than the standard treatment. This article will briefly review the original experience with the gemcitabine/cisplatin doublet and then examine the experience to date with non-cisplatin-based gemcitabine doublet combinations in the treatment of advanced NSCLC.","title":"Advances in treatment of inoperable NSCLC: gemcitabine doublets--a promising alternative.","pubmedId":"10960939"}
