However, clinical Phase I or Phase II trials with compounds targeting classical PKC isoforms were not successful. Recent studies implicate that mainly atypical and novel PKC enzymes regulate oncogenic signaling pathways in pancreatic cancer. Members of these two subgroups converge signaling induced by mutant Kras, growth factors and inflammatory cytokines. Different approaches for the development of inhibitors for atypical PKC and novel PKC have been described; and new compounds include allosteric inhibitors and inhibitors that block ATP binding.","title":"Targeting protein kinase C subtypes in pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"25604078"}
