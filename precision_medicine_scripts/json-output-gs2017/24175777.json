The aim of the present study was to analyze mutations and gene expression profiles of the PI3KCA gene to determine any role in breast carcinomas.\nWe analyzed 38 breast cancers for mutations in the two PIK3CA hotspots in exons 9 and 20 by direct sequencing of DNA obtained from biopsy samples. We have also analyzed expression of the PI3KCA gene in 38 breast carcinoma tumor and corresponding control tissue samples at the mRNA level by RT-PCR. The Fisher\u0027s exact test (2?2 only) was performed using MedCalc software for to examine associations with mRNA levels.\nIn the present study a total of 13 cases demonstrated somatic mutations. In 9/13 cases 1633 G\u003eA (E545K) were found in exon 9, whereas in exon 20, 4/13 cases had 3140A\u003eG mutation. Our combined analysis showed PI3KCA mutations present in 34% of human breast cancer patients. In our study, we have also clearly found significantly higher expression in breast cancer tissues in comparison with control tissues (p\u003d0.001).\nPIK3CA mutation is an emerging tumor marker that, in the future, might be used in the process of choosing a treatment. The detection of PI3KCA mutation might have important clinical implications for diagnosis, progression and therapy.","title":"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3KCA) oncogene mutation analysis and gene expression profiling in primary breast cancer patients.","pubmedId":"24175777"}
