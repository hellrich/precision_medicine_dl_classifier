Here we screened 15 Turkish breast and breast-ovarian cancer families for mutations in both genes by conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) and the protein truncation test (PTT), followed by DNA sequencing. Three families included a male breast cancer case, one without family history. Three germline mutations were identified, two in BRCA1 and one in BRCA2. The two BRCA1 mutations, 5382insC and 5622C--\u003eT, were found in breast-ovarian cancer families. The BRCA2 3414delTCAG is a novel mutation detected in a site-specific breast cancer family that included 1 case of male breast cancer. These first results of Turkish families show that the frequency of germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations appears to be high in families with at least 3 breast and/or ovarian cancer cases.","title":"Mutation analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in Turkish cancer families: a novel mutation BRCA2 3414del4 found in male breast cancer.","pubmedId":"10505028"}
