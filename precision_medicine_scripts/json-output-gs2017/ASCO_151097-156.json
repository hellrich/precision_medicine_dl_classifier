The aim of this study was to correlate the dynamics of KRAS mutational load in ctDNA with clinical responses in patients with lung adenocarcinoma receiving surgical treatment, radiation, or chemotherapy.  Methods:  In a blinded biomarker study of 30 patients, urine samples were obtained from 7 patients with metastatic or early stage lung adenocarcinoma harboring KRAS G12/13 mutation in the tumor tissue by CLIA laboratory testing. Following extraction of urinary ctDNA, KRAS G12/13 mutational load was quantified using a next generation sequencing-based method with standardized reporting of mutant copies per 105genome equivalents.  Results:  Of 7 patients enrolled, 6 patients with lung adenocarcinoma had serial urine collections with up to 3 specimens at 1-3 month intervals. Three of 7 patients had metastatic disease receiving chemotherapy, and 2 of 3 had serial detectable KRAS mutation in urinary ctDNA which tested positive 1 to 2 months prior to radiologic progression. In 3 of 4 patients with definitive stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or surgery for early stage cancer, and now with no clinical evidence of disease, mutant KRAS was not detectable in urinary ctDNA at any time points after surgery. In 1 of 4 patients with early stage disease, imaging was suspicious for progression, and this presentation correlated with an increase in urinary ctDNA KRAS mutation load after surgery.  Conclusions:  We demonstrate feasibility of monitoring minimal residual disease and responses to chemotherapy in patients with KRAS G12/13-positive lung adenocarcinoma using a completely non-invasive urine sample.","title":"Non-Invasive Monitoring of Urinary KRAS Circulating Tumor DNA for Treatment Response and Minimal Residual Disease in Patients with Lung Adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"ASCO_151097-156"}
