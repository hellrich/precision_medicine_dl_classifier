Plasma concentrations of markers were measured before and after surgery. Patients with non-malignant disorders served as controls.\nThe conventional and stromal substances were expressed in the cancer cell compartment and the stroma, respectively. Although most patients had increased levels of many markers before surgery, 2/12 (17%) of patients had normal levels of Ca 19-9 at this stage. High preoperative endostatin/type XVIII collagen, and postoperative type IV collagen was associated with short survival. Neither the pre- nor postoperative levels of TPS, Ca 125 or CA 19-9 were associated to survival.\nPDAC is characterized by an abundant stroma. These initial observations indicate that the stroma can be a source of PDAC tumour markers that are found in different compartments of the cancer, thus reflecting different aspects of tumour biology.","title":"Combining conventional and stroma-derived tumour markers in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"25524936"}
