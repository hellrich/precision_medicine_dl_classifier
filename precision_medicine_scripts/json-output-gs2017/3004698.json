Renal adenocarcinoma is extremely rare in childhood, compared with nephroblastoma (Wilms\u0027 tumor). In all tumor cells the same 46,XY,t(X;1) (p11.2;q21.2) karyotype was found. This karyotype is compared with the cytogenetic descriptions of renal adenocarcinoma in adults.","title":"Cytogenetics of a renal adenocarcinoma in a 2-year-old child.","pubmedId":"3004698"}
