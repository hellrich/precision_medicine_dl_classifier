In this study we investigated ALK protein expression in 302 NSCLCs and 291 gastric carcinomas by means of immunohistochemical analysis. Twelve (4.0%) NSCLCs, but none of the gastric carcinomas, were found to be positive for ALK. The ALK signal was detected in the cytoplasm of cancer cells. Subsequent RNA analysis of 10 RNA-available, immunohistochemically ALK-positive tumors revealed that three tumors had EML4-ALK variant 1, three tumors had variant 2, three tumors had variants 3a and 3b, and one tumor had a novel variant in which exon 14 of EML4 is connected to the nucleotide at position 53 of exon 20 of ALK by a 2-bp insertion. These results suggest that immunohistochemical ALK detection is a useful way to screen NSCLCs for tumors containing ALK fusions.","title":"EML4-ALK fusion transcripts in immunohistochemically ALK-positive non-small cell lung carcinomas.","pubmedId":"22993539"}
