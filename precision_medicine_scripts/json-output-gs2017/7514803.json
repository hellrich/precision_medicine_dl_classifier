In benign hyperplasia the SK antibody reacted with acinar and duct epithelial cells; the StK and BSK antibodies reacted strongly with duct epithelial cells in the canine mammary tumours expressed mainly keratins of stratified epithelia rather than those of simple epithelia. Myoepithelial cells in complex and mixed tumours can express StK and vimentin. The finding might be helpful in the assessment of complex tumours where stromal reactions may be confused with myoepithelial neoplastic proliferation. Stromal mesenchymal tissues, including precartilage in complex tumours, and clearly differentiated myoepithelial cells always stained positively for vimentin. Occasional carcinoma cells stained positively for vimentin.","title":"Immunohistochemical localisation of cytokeratin and vimentin intermediate filament proteins in canine mammary tumours.","pubmedId":"7514803"}
