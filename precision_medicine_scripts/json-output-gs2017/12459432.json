A patient who presented with biventricular failure and constrictive hemodynamics years after successful resection of a primary liposarcoma of the thigh is described. Extensive cardiac encasement by tumor was suspected on diagnostic imaging. Hemodynamic instability and multiorgan failure necessitated urgent exploratory sternotomy. The patient died intraoperatively. Extensive metastatic sarcoma limited to the heart was confirmed during surgical procedure. This case suggests that in clinical and pathological investigation of a cardiac mass, knowledge of previous extracardiac involvement with soft tissue sarcoma is essential.","title":"Cardiac encasement by metastatic myxoid liposarcoma.","pubmedId":"12459432"}
