Gly12Asp was the most frequent (34.1%), followed by Gly12Cys (22.0%) and Gly12Val (13.4%). Transversion at codons 12 and 13, which includes Gly12Cys, Gly12Val, Gly12Ala, Gly13Cys, and Gly12Phe was detected in 45 cases (54.9%) and transition, including Gly12Asp, Gly12Ser, and Gly13Asp was detected in 37 cases (45.1%). Male and smoking history were associated with transversion (p\u003d0.001 and 0.006, respectively; χ(2)-test), and multivariate analysis showed that gender was an independent influencing factor (p\u003d0.026; Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test). Multivariate analysis on survival revealed that KRAS mutation subtype did not influence overall survival of the patients with KRAS mutations after adjustment for age, gender, performance status, and stage. There were no differences in the nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of pAKT-Ser473 between transversion and transition mutants. Expression of Ral-GTPases, RalA and RalB, did not differ between transversion and transition mutants, however, strong expression of RalB in the tissue of patients with KRAS mutants was associated with advanced stages (P-value\u003d0.020, χ(2)-test).\nIn this study population, not only the frequency of KRAS mutation but also the distribution of its subtypes differed from those of Western studies, with unique influencing factors. Clinical outcome and expression of pAKT-Ser473, RalA, and RalB did not differ among subtypes.","title":"KRAS oncogene substitutions in Korean NSCLC patients: clinical implication and relationship with pAKT and RalGTPases expression.","pubmedId":"24863005"}
