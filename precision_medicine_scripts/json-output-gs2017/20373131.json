Gene therapies have been explored to effectively create a microenvironment less favorable for angiogenesis and tumor expansion. In this study, we examined the inhibitory effect of cationic liposome coupled with the murine endostatin gene (Lipo/mEndo) on growth of intraperitoneal disseminated colon cancer models. Intraperitoneal injection of Lipo/mEndo inhibited bioluminescent signals emitted from CT26 colon cancer cells stably expressing luciferase in the living mice and prolonged their survival times. Endostatin gene therapy suppressed the colony forming capability and VEGF concentration of ascites obtained from treated mice by 74 and 60%, respectively. When tested in a similar model using HCT116 human colon cancer cells, Lipo/mEndo and bevacizumab displayed comparable repressive effects on ascites formation and tumor foci dissemination on mesentery of experimental mice. Our results implicate that cationic liposome coupled endostatin gene therapy may be a clinically effective treatment for intraperitoneal disseminated colon cancer.","title":"Cationic liposome coupled endostatin gene for treatment of peritoneal colon cancer.","pubmedId":"20373131"}
