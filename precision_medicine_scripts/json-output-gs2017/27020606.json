As the pro-apoptotic p53 protein may be involved in the lifecycle of KA, we studied the p53 status throughout the main stages of KA that include proliferation, maturation and regression in a large series of lesions.\nOne-hundred and twenty-four KAs were characterized with respect to age of the lesions both clinically and histopathologically, in addition to phenotypic characteristics such as cellular atypia, infiltration, inflammation and fibrosis. Tp53 mutations were detected by capillary electrophoresis, and p53 protein levels were assessed by immunohistochemistry.\nTp53 mutations were detected in 49 cases (39.5%) and were associated with high p53 protein levels (p \u003d 0.007) and histopathologic age of the lesions (p \u003d 0.044). Significant association was also seen between high p53 protein levels and atypia (p \u003d 0.036), whereas the association with infiltration showed borderline significance (p \u003d 0.057). High p53 protein levels were significantly associated with gene mutations in transplanted, but not in non-transplanted patients.\nWe show a high frequency of Tp53 mutations in KAs that is associated with increased p53 levels. The results indicate a role for the p53 protein in KA development.","title":"Tp53/p53 status in keratoacanthomas.","pubmedId":"27020606"}
