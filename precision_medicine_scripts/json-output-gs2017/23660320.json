All had a history of surgical resection for primary neoplasm and bilioenteric anastomosis. Four cases had intrahepatic biliary dilatation pneumatosis.\nAll lesions were completely ablated according to the results of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) or contrast-enhanced computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) at Month 1 post-MWA. Liver abscess and fistula occurred in 5 ablation zones (5/10) of 4 patients. Three cases were satisfactorily cured with antibiotic dosing, catheter drainage and supportive care. One case died 13 days after MWA. The overall 1, 2, 3-year survival rates of were 64.8%, 21.6% and 21.0% respectively (median: 15.7 months).\nA high technical success rate of MWA is obtained in the treatment of intrahepatic metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with bilioenteric anastomosis. However, the incidence of abscess formation remains high due to a coexistence of multiple risk factors.","title":"[Complications and clinical outcomes of microwave ablation for liver metastatic cholangiocarcinoma after bilioenteric anastomosis].","pubmedId":"23660320"}
