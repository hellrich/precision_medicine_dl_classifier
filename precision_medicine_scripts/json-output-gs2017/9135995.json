However, many such families show no evidence of mutations in the coding regions of CDKN2A. In this study, we examined whether two other potential tumor suppressors, CDKN2B and p19ARF, which also map within the 9p21 region, play a role in the development of familial melanoma. We found no mutations in the coding regions of either gene in melanoma-prone families with evidence of linkage to 9p21. We conclude either that another melanoma susceptibility gene exists within this chromosomal area or that mutations in noncoding regions of CDKN2A, CDKN2B, or p19ARF predispose to melanoma.","title":"Affected members of melanoma-prone families with linkage to 9p21 but lacking mutations in CDKN2A do not harbor mutations in the coding regions of either CDKN2B or p19ARF.","pubmedId":"9135995"}
