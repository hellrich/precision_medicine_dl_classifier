Little is known about possible molecular alterations in gastrinomas, tumors that may be particularly virulent because of gastrin overproduction, resulting in the severe ulcer diathesis, the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\nThe differential polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure was used to detect amplification of the HER-2/neu gene in DNA samples from the novel human gastrinoma cell line (PT) and from paraffin-embedded samples of gastrinomas. Sequencing techniques were used to determine whether mutations of the p53 or ras (Ha-ras, N-ras, Ki-ras) genes were present.\nAmplification (\u003e twofold) occurred in all gastrinoma tumor samples. Compared with normal pancreas or ileum, a 4- to 12-fold amplification of HER-2/neu was found in 3 gastrinomas, 3 to 3.3-fold in four samples and 2.1- to 2.4-fold in the remaining five tumors. A heterozygous point mutation in the p53 gene (codon 273) was found in a single sample; none of the gastrinomas contained a mutation of the ras genes.\nAmplification of the HER-2/neu gene, but not alterations of either p53 or ras, may be involved in the pathogenesis of gastrinomas. The unique PT cell line will be a useful model to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms that contribute to gastrinoma formation and growth.","title":"Gastrinomas demonstrate amplification of the HER-2/neu proto-oncogene.","pubmedId":"7911296"}
