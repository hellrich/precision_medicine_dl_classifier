In the plain CT scan of 6 cases, all masses showed higher density and without clear boundary, and 5 masses accompany obvious peritumoral edema. In plain MRI scan, all of the tumors appeared with irregular shape and unclear boundaries, 8 of the masses with obvious peritumoral edema. Enhanced scan showed all cases were significantly enhanced and the meninges in 7 cases thicken irregularly and extensively. The pathology showed that the tumors were irregularly shaped with grayish red or grayish white cut surfaces. Histological examination showed that the tumors consisted of abundant and diverse cells and different numbers of spindle tumor cells, and meningeal epithelial cells in the background of abundant inflammatory cells could be seen. The 9 cases all had surgery; only 1 case of recurrence in the first year after the operation was noted in the follow-up over 1 to 4 years, and no recurrence could be found after the second surgery.\nLymphoplasmacyte-rich meningioma is a seldom-seen subtype meningioma of WHO grade I, often accompanying anemia or polyclonal immunoglobulin hyperplasia, which can recover to normal state after removing the masses. The masses showed higher density and without clear boundary in plain CT scan, and most of the tumors appear with irregular shape, obvious edema, and significant enhancement in the MRI scan. The prognosis is favorable after surgical resection and the recurrence rate is low.","title":"Imaging findings and clinical features of intracal lymphoplasmacyte-rich meningioma.","pubmedId":"25643346"}
