Recently, somatic mutations of ERBB3 gene, including recurrent mutation in exon 3 altering Val104, were reported in gastric cancers (GC) and colorectal cancers (CRC), strongly suggesting its role in the development of GC and CRC. To examine whether the recurrent ERBB3 mutations of exon 3 occur in GC and CRC, and other malignancies as well, we analyzed the ERBB3 in 1677 cancer tissues by a single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) assay. We identified ERBB3 mutations altering the Val104 mutations in GC (0.5%) and CRC (2.2%). However, we did not find the ERBB3 mutations in the other cancers besides GC and CRC. We observed that an increased intensity of phosphorylated ERBB3 (pERBB3) in GC and CRC. Of note, all of the cancers with ERBB3 mutations displayed an increased intensity of pERBB3 immunostaining. Our data indicate that the recurrent ERBB3 mutations altering Val104 occur predominantly in GC and CRC. Also, the data suggest that ERBB3 is altered in GC and CRC by various ways, including somatic mutations and increased expression that might play roles in tumorigenesis.","title":"Mutational and expressional analysis of ERBB3 gene in common solid cancers.","pubmedId":"24909266"}
