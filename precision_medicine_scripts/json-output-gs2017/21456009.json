This racial/ethnic survival gap has been explained in part by differences in tumor characteristics, stage at diagnosis, and disparities in receipt of definitive treatment. Another potential contributing factor is racial/ethnic differences in the timely and accurate detection of lymph node metastases. The current study was conducted to examine the association between race/ethnicity and the receipt of pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) among men with localized/regional PCa.\nLogistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds of undergoing PLND among men who were diagnosed during 2000 to 2002 with PCa, who underwent radical prostatectomy or PLND without radical prostatectomy, and who were diagnosed in regions covered by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (n \u003d 40,848).\nBlack men were less likely to undergo PLND than white men (odds ratio [OR], 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-0.98). When the analysis was stratified by PCa grade, black men with well differentiated PCa (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.27-0.84) and poorly differentiated PCa (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60-0.89) were less likely to undergo PLND than their white counterparts, but racial differences were not observed among men with moderately differentiated PCa (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.88-1.05).\nAmong men with poorly differentiated PCa, failure to undergo PLND was associated with worse survival. Racial disparities in the receipt of PLND, especially among men with poorly differentiated PCa, may contribute to racial differences in prostate cancer survival.","title":"Racial/ethnic differences in receipt of pelvic lymph node dissection among men with localized/regional prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"21456009"}
