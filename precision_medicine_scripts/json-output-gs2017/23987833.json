A favorable trend in median time to progression (4.4 vs 3.0 months), progression-free survival (4.4 vs 2.6 months) and overall survival (17.4 vs 13.3 months) was found in group A. A trend toward higher overall response rate (6.4 vs 4.9%) and disease control rate (34.0 vs 26.8%) also favored group A. Both groups had equivalent safety profiles.\nAll efficacy outcomes were better in patients who received trabectedin as second-line treatment compared with patients with more extensive prior therapy.","title":"Efficacy and safety of trabectedin as an early treatment for advanced or metastatic liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma.","pubmedId":"23987833"}
