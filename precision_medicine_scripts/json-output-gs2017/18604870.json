Although EBV infection may be involved at an early stage of gastric carcinogenesis, the mechanisms underlying its involvement remain unknown. To investigate the role of EBV in gastric carcinogenesis, we performed proteomic analyses of an EBV-infected gastric carcinoma cell line NU-GC-3 (EBV(+)) and its uninfected control (EBV(-)). 2-DE was combined with MS to identify differentially expressed proteins. We found that EBV infection upregulated one of the phosphorylated heat shock protein 27 kDa (HSP27). The phosphorylated HSP27 isoform which increased in EBV(+) cells can be induced by both heat shock and arsenite. The increase of phosphorylated HSP27 in EBV(+) cells was reduced by treatment with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors (LY294002 and wortmannin). In addition, we found increased levels of phosphorylated Akt in EBV(+) cells. These findings suggest that EBV infection upregulates the phosphorylation of HSP27 via the PI3K/Akt pathway. Thus, activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway may contribute to the establishment of a malignant phenotype in EBV-infected gastric carcinomas.","title":"Epstein-Barr virus upregulates phosphorylated heat shock protein 27 kDa in carcinoma cells using the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway.","pubmedId":"18604870"}
