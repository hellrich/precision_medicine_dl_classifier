Studies investigating the clinical and biologic features of CRC Turkey are small retrospective case series providing limited information. We initiated a Turkish National CRC Registry program in October 2012 to define clinical and pathological variables of CRC. Methods:  Pts presenting to medical oncology clinics were prospectively registered in 28 centers nationwide. Pt demographics and clinicopathological characteristics were recorded. Results:  6143 pts (mean age 58.212.3) were analyzed (57% males). Mean ages of males were higher (59 vs 57 yrs, p \u003d 0.001). Adenocarcinoma was the most common histology (97.8%). Initial stages at diagnosis: I (5.4%), II (29.6%), III (33.8%) and IV (20.2%), unknown (9.8%). Pts from Eastern Turkey were younger (56 vs 59, p \u003c 0.001) with a more advanced stage (metastatic pts, 26.5% vs 18.4%). T stage was unknown in 22%, and T3 (46%) and T4 (20%) tumors were most commonly observed. Median number of examined and involved lymph nodes were 14 (1-148) and 1, respectively. Lymphovascular and perineural invasion were present in 27.7% and 21.2%. Most common tumor sites were rectum (35%), and sigmoid (24%). Surgery was done in 85.4%: hemi/partial colectomy (35%), LAR (34%), APR (4.6%), total colectomy (3.6%). Metastasectomy was done in 16.9% with R0 resection in 15.9%. Adjuvant chemo was given to 66.3% of nonmetastatic patients with fluoropyrimidines and oxaliplatin-based regimens. 10.8% pts received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. 33% pts had metastasis (at diagnosis or recurrent disease): liver (62%), lung (26%) and others. Metastatic pts received chemo in combination with bevacizumab in 53.5%. KRAS was available in 41% and BRAF in 3% of metastatic pts. Of these, 61% were KRAS wild-type and 20% BRAF mutant. Cetuximab in first-line was rare (3.7% total, 16% of KRAS wild-type). Conclusions:  This study is the first comprehensive CRC registry in Turkey. Pt demographics were similar to Western countries including molecular studies. However, molecular testing was not readily available in most of the metastatic cases. A low rate of biologicals use in combination therapies in metastatic pts may result in inferior pt outcome overall.","title":"Turkish National Colon Cancer Registry.","pubmedId":"ASCO_150052-156"}
