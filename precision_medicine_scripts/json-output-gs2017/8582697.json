Early detection of hypertension, before organ manifestations particularly in the heart, the kidney and the vessels occur, remain mandatory since in most of the patients with mild and moderate hypertension the high blood pressure is not diagnosed at all or treated inadequately. Prevention of cardiac, vascular, renal or metabolic complications has always been better for the patient and less costly than their repair or reparation. Our present treatment goals have often not reached far enough. Normalisation of blood pressure demonstrates only surrogate efficacy of our treatment. Our ultimate goal has to be improvement of total or cerebrovascular or cardiovascular and cardiac mortality. Important steps on that road are the prevention or reparation of cardiac hypertrophy, of the increased extracellular matrix and collagen deposition, the conservation of vascular integrity including both coronary and systemic microangiopathy and macroangiopathy. For the patient this means integrated care of his associated disorders that is of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, lipid disorders, overweight and the metabolic syndrome. True health efficacy (\u003d reduction of total or cerebro- and cardiovascular mortality) has been demonstrated so far only by blood pressure reduction with diuretics (thiazides) and beta-blockers in long term studies, whereas sufficient surrogate efficacy, the lowering of blood pressure, has been demonstrated with almost all the others drugs either in mono- or in combinationtherapy. Together with ACE-inhibitors, which have demonstrated their prognostic value in patients with heart failure of different causes, thiazides (as the most representative diuretic) and betablockade can be considered first line drugs in the treatment of hypertension. Long-term mortality trials for ACE-inhibitors in hypertension are needed, however, to prove that the anticipated benefit from the heart failure megatrials can also be taken for granted for hypertensive patients without coronary artery disease as well. All other drugs should not or not yet be considered first line medication, although treatment behavior in the US and in Europe shows wide-spread use of calcium antagonists in short- and long-acting dihydropyridine type hypertensive patients. No peer reviewed journal has so far published a randomized double-blind trial with the endpoint of total or cardiovascular mortality in hypertension using calcium antagonists. A recent case control study, as well as the preliminary data from MIDAS and GLANT, for which event rates are available in abstract form, suggest that short acting calcium-antagonists of the dihydropyridine type, though controlling blood pressure well, are not reducing mortality but show a trend to increase cardiovascular events particularly when given in higher doses. In contrast the unpublished data from a Chinese megatrial with dihydropyridines (STONE) demonstrate effective blood pressure reduction and benefit in mortality in a population that differs from patients in Europe and in the USA because of the low prevalence of coronary artery disease. No randomized, double blindly acquired data on mortality as the primary end of antihypertensive treatment are yet available for verapamil, diltiazem and the new class of longer acting calciumantagonists. Only when speculating from trials with calcium antagonists in coronary artery disease e.g. the DAVIT II study, one could imagine so far that prognostic benefit may be expected from drugs that do not or very little activate the adrenergic and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the baroreceptors and reduce or at least maintain heart rate. The need for double blind, randomized trials with the different Ca-antagonists is obvious, before a further w","title":"[Retrospective studies and prospects of therapy for hypertension].","pubmedId":"8582697"}
