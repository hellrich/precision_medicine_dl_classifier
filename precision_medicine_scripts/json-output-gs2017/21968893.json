In Switzerland cervical cancer is nowadays a relative rare cancer with annually 230 new cases. Decreasing incidence, observed in all age groups, is certainly due to improved primary and secondary prevention such as comprehensive screening programs and in future with vaccination against human papilloma viruses.

This review article summarizes the current standard of care with and the available treatment modalities.","title":"[Cervical cancer].","pubmedId":"21968893"}
