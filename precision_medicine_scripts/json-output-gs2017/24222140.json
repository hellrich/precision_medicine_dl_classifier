Prognostic factors for improved progression-free survival (PFS) were absence of pelvic lymph node metastasis at initial presentation (p\u003d0.014), and EQD2 at point A greater than 60 Gy (p\u003d0.023).\nPatients with stage IVA disease had poor median survival. However adequate radiation dose to point A produced favorable LCR and PFS, therefore efforts should be made to increase the point A dose.","title":"Radiation therapy for stage IVA cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"24222140"}
