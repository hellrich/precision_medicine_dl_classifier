Major five of these fragments were cloned. All of the cloned fragments were mapped at the 19q13.1-13.2 region where the AKT2 oncogene was located. Southern blotting using the cloned DNA fragments and a fragment of AKT2 cDNA as probes revealed that the AKT2 gene was amplified in 3 of 12 pancreatic cancer cell lines analyzed including PANC1 and in 3 of 20 primary pancreatic cancers. The AKT2 gene was overexpressed in the 3 cell lines with the amplified gene. The results suggest that the AKT2 gene is a candidate oncogene activated by amplification in some human pancreatic cancers.","title":"Isolation of DNA sequences amplified at chromosome 19q13.1-q13.2 including the AKT2 locus in human pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"8780719"}
