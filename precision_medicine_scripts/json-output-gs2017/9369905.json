In future, however, each standard therapy should be established against the respective subgroups of lung cancer, which will be more precisely defined depending on the biological or the molecular basis, like malignant lymphoma. Much evidence is increasing to help understand the mechanisms mediating differences in clinical behavior and neuroendocrine features between small cell and non-small cell lung cancer. Here we showed the experimental models of tissue-specific gene therapy targeting CEA- or Myc-overexpressing lung cancer cell lines.","title":"[Treatment based on biological characteristics of lung cancer: biological differences between small cell and non-small cell lung cancer and gene therapy].","pubmedId":"9369905"}
