Using a microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer (CRC) cell line (Colo741) having mutated BRAF and KRASWT, we also aimed to investigate the KRAS-BRAF interaction. Gene expression profiles for control KRASWT, KRAS G12V and KRAS G12D transfected cells were obtained after cell clone selection and RT-PCR screening. Extensive qPCR was performed to confirm microarray data.\nWe found that the KRAS G12V state deregulated several genes associated to cell cycle, apoptosis and nitrogen metabolism. These findings indicated a reduced survival and proliferation with respect to the KRASWT state. The KRAS G12D state was, instead, characterized by several other distinct functional changes as for example those related to chromatin organization and cell-cell adhesion without affecting apoptosis related genes.\nThese data predict that the G12D mutation may be more likely selected in a BRAF mutated context. At the same time, the presence of the KRAS G12V mutation in the cells escaping apoptosis and inducing angiogenesis via IL8 may confer a more aggressive phenotype. The present results get along with the observations that CRCs with G12V are associated with a worse prognosis with respect to the WT and G12D states and may help identifying novel CRC pathways and biomarkers of clinical relevance.","title":"Gene expression deregulation by KRAS G12D and G12V in a BRAF V600E context.","pubmedId":"19087308"}
