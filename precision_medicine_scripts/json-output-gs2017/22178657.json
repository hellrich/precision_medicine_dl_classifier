Design of rational treatment has been hampered by lack of insight into the pathogenesis of the disease. Recently more insight has been gained into a number of crucial aspects of pancreatic carcinogenesis, in particular the cell types that can give rise to oncological transformation in the pancreas, different modes of interaction between transformed pancreatic cells and the stroma that fosters further disease progression, the need of the pancreatic tumour cells to overcome the pressure of immune surveillance and the various changes in intercellular biochemistry that tumour cells employ to both sustain chemoresistance and metastasis. Although still largely incomplete, this new knowledge opens novel avenues on more successful treatment of the disease through personalised medicine.","title":"Pancreatic cancer: promise for personalised medicine?","pubmedId":"22178657"}
