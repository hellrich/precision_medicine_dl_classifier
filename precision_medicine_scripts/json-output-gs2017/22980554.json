After six cycles of first line chemotherapy with cisplatine-vinorelbine followed by maintenance treatment with erlotinib, the patient achieved a partial response. After disease progression, the patient was included in a trial comparing crizotinib with a classic 2nd line chemotherapy. After 1 month of crizotinib, the patient\u0027s condition improved. CT of the chest showed a near-total regression of bilateral pulmonary nodules replaced by pulmonary cysts.\nWe report in this case a dramatic improvement with near-complete vanishing of pulmonary nodules replaced by pulmonary cysts in a patient treated with crizotinib. This case reminds us of the potential importance of evaluating the molecular diagnosis in lung cancers and especially in adenocarcinoma of the lung.","title":"[Cavitating nodules in a 40-year-old non-smoking woman: a very particular tumour].","pubmedId":"22980554"}
