{"publicationTypes":["2012 ASCO Annual Meeting"],"abstract":"Background:  The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel as neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in patients affected by locally advanced cervical cancer.  Methods:  Between June 2007 to May 2009, all patients with diagnosis of IB2-IIB cervical cancer were considered eligible for this protocol. All enrolled patients received 3 cycles of carboplatin (AUC6) and paclitaxel at 175 mg/mq in neadjuvant setting. The chemotherapy induced toxicity and response to the treatment were evaluated according to World Health Organization criteria.  Results:  We have enrolled 23 patients with diagnosis of locally advanced cervical cancer. A total of 22 patients completed planned 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After 3 cycles of chemotherapy 9 out of 23 patients (42%) showed a complete response, 7 patients (35%) partial response, 5 patients (16%) stable disease and 2 patients (11%) showed disease progression. The most common toxicity was haematologic (43%), extra haematologic toxicities were nausea/vomiting, neuropathy and alopecia, that occurred in 45%, 13% and 25% respectively. No renal and grade 3 and 4 haematologic toxicities were registered.  Conclusions:  Our results suggest that the use of carboplatin, in neadjuvant setting, is a well tolerated drug, produces manageable toxicity with a response rate similar to standard cisplatin. Then, it rappresents a valid alternative in patients affected by locally advanced cervical cancer.","title":"Use of carboplatinum as neoadjuvant setting for patients affected by locally advanced cervical cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_98758-114"}
