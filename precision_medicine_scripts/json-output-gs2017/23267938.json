We examined the effect of preoperative chemoradiation for cStage II bile duct cancer. From 2008 until 2011, 75 cases were compared in terms of the preoperative diagnosis and pathological diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma in our department. Additionally, 19 cases had been diagnosed as cStage II. However, 12 cases were higher than pStage III in their pathological diagnosis. We did not obtain pCur A in only 12 cases(63%). On the other hand, we obtained HM0, DM0, EM0, and pCur A in 5 patients with cStage II cholangiocarcinoma who underwent preoperative chemoradiation therapy. The neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy for cholangiocarcinoma may control local cancer progression, thereby improving the surgical results of cStage II cholangiocarcinoma in this study.","title":"[Efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy for clinical Stage II cholangiocarcinoma as a preoperative diagnosis].","pubmedId":"23267938"}
