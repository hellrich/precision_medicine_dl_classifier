However, the associations between gene mutations and cytotoxic chemosensitivity are still unclear. The objective of the present study was to identify which clinicopathological factors, including genetic mutations, influence chemosensitivity, determined using the succinate dehydrogenase inhibition (SDI) test in patients with NSCLC.\nThe chemosensitivity of tumor tissues from 96 patients with NSCLC who underwent surgical resection was evaluated using the SDI test.\nIn patients with adenocarcinoma, tumors with EGFR gene mutations were significantly more sensitive to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) than tumors without EGFR gene mutations (p\u003c0.0149).\nOur data suggest that patients with adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR gene mutations may be susceptible to 5-FU.","title":"Associations between driver gene mutations and cytotoxic chemosensitivity in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"25750344"}
