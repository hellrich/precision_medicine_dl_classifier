An immunohistochemical screening may be useful to identify MET amplification. The aim of our study was to establish how MET immunolabeling correlates with MET amplification.\nThree cohorts including 108 GBM (cohort 1, prospective), 104 GBM (cohort 2, retrospective) and 52 GBM (cohort 3, prospective) were investigated for MET expression by immunohistochemistry. MET amplification was assessed by comparative genomic hybridization on micro-array (CGH-array) in all cohorts and by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in cohorts 2 and 3. Active form of MET was assessed using p-MET (Y1349) immunohistochemistry.\nDiffuse MET amplification detectable by CGH-array was associated with diffuse, strong MET immunolabeling (4 cases in cohort 1 and 1 case in cohort 2). Focal MET amplification detectable only by FISH was observed in small foci of strongly immunopositive cells in two GBM (cohort 2). In both cohorts, MET amplification was never detected in GBM devoid of strongly immunopositive cells. MET overexpression, observed in 23% of unamplified-GBM, was associated with a predominant weak to moderate staining intensity and with necrosis (p\u003c 0.005). p-MET was detected in all MET amplified-GBM and in perinecrotic areas of non amplified-GBM. A strong MET immunostaining intensity, at least focal and distant from necrosis, showed 100% sensitivity and 84% specificity for predicting MET amplification in cohort 3.\nMET amplification is characterized by strongly immunopositive cells. Only GBM showing strong MET immunostaining is appropriate for the assessment of MET amplification. This article is protected by copyright.
