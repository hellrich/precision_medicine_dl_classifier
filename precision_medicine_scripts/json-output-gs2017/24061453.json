The number of cases stained positive with MDM2 and p53 were positive correlated in all subjects (P \u003d 0.02). p53 and MDM2 positivity increased in high grade tumors (P \u003d 0.01).\np53 and MDM2 immuno-reactivity was found to be potentially useful in liposarcoma diagnosis but a definitive implication would be rather unhealthy due to the small number of cases in our study.","title":"Immunohistochemical detection of p53 and MDM2 expressions in liposarcoma with World health organization classification.","pubmedId":"24061453"}
