Gastric cancer has not been extensively profiled for transduction pathway proteins. Here we report the prevalence of HER1, HER2, p95HER2, HER3, IGF1-R, c-MET, PI3K, Shc, VEGFR, panCK, and other signal transduction pathway protein expression and their levels of activation in GC patients. Methods: From 2004 to 2006, 500 GC surgical specimens were procured at Samsung Medical Center. All of the specimens were collected during gastrectomy and were appropriately frozen at - 80 C. All of the specimens were analyzed at Prometheus, CA, USA. We applied COPIA to investigate the levels of expression and activation of signaling proteins in frozen tissues collected from GC patients. The Collaborative Proximity Immunoassay (COPIA) is a multiplexed protein microarray platform that utilizes the formation of a unique immuno-complex requiring co-localization of two detector-antibodies. The detector-antibodies are conjugated with corresponding channeling-enzymes, glucose oxidase (GO) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Once target proteins are bound by the capture antibodies, the channeling events between GO and HRP in proximity enables the profiling of the target proteins with extreme sensitivity. COPIA delivers extremely high analytical specificity as it requires multiple entities within target specific proximity for the signal generation/amplification. COPIA can also be configured for each specific target protein to allow differential detection of truncated targets (i.e., p95HER2) from their normal counter parts (i.e., HER2). Results: We will be reporting on the prevalence of HER1, HER2, p95HER2, HER3, IGF1-R, c-MET, PI3K, Shc, VEGFR, panCK, and other signal transduction pathway protein expression and their levels of activation in 500 GC patients. Conclusions: The treatment of recurrent or metastatic GC may be optimized by functional profiling of GC. In addition, the incidence of alteration in transduction pathway proteins may guide oncologists for further clinical development of targeted therapies or combined therapies.","title":"Functional profiling of signal transduction pathway proteins in gastric cancer (GC) patients.","pubmedId":"ASCO_48519-74"}
