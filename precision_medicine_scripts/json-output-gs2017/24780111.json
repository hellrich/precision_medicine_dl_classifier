EGFR-TKIs have become the standard first-line treatment for advanced EGFR-mutation NSCLC, while for EGFR wild-type tumors, the preferred first-line treatment is chemotherapy. However, the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs as second-line treatment in EGFR wild-type NSCLC remains controversial. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of EGFR-TKI as second-line treatment in EGFR wild-type NSCLC.\nRandomized controlled trials that compared EGFR-TKIs with chemotherapy in previously treated advanced NSCLC with wild-type EGFR were included. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of EGFR-TKIs compared with standard chemotherapy. The endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and objective response rate (ORR).\nSix randomized controlled trials with a total of 990 patients with wild-type EGFR were included: 499 in the EGFR-TKIs group and 491 in the chemotherapy group. The results indicated that in the second-line treatment of EGFR wild-type advanced NSCLC, PFS was significantly inferior in the EGFR-TKIs group versus the chemotherapy group (HR\u003d1.37, 95% CI\u003d1.20-1.56, P\u003c0.00001). However, this significant difference did not translate into OS (HR\u003d1.02, 95% CI\u003d0.87-1.20, P\u003d0.81). ORR tended to favor chemotherapy but there was no significant difference compared with EGFR-TKI (RR\u003d1.77, 95% CI\u003d0.90-3.50, P\u003d0.10).\nChemotherapy improves PFS significantly but not OS, compared with EGFR-TKIs as a second-line treatment in advanced NSCLC with wild-type EGFR. Whether EGFR-TKIs should be used in EGFR wild-type patients should be considered carefully.","title":"Efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors versus chemotherapy as second-line treatment in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with wild-type EGFR: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials.","pubmedId":"24780111"}
