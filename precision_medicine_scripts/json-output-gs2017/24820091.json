Distant metastasis is a main cause of death in FTC patients. Several studies showed that the presence of RAS mutations is also associated with poor clinical outcomes. We analyzed RAS mutations in FTC with distant metastases, FTC without a distant metastasis, follicular adenoma (FA), and nodular hyperplasia (NH). Furthermore, we elucidated the relationship between RAS mutations and clinical outcomes in FTC patients.\nWe selected patients who underwent a thyroidectomy for FTC with distant metastases (n\u003d28), size matched FTC specimens without a distant metastasis (n\u003d28), FA (n\u003d17), and NH (n\u003d12). NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS mutations were assessed using direct sequencing.\nAmong 85 patients, 39 patients (46%) had RAS mutations. The NRAS codon 61 mutation (n\u003d21; 25%) was the most common point mutation. HRAS codon 61, KRAS codon 12/13, and KRAS codon 61 mutations were found in 7, 6, and 4 patients, respectively. A NRAS codon 12/13 mutation was found in only 1 patient, and a HRAS codon 12/13 mutation was not found. RAS mutations were significantly more common in the FTC than FA or NH groups. Especially, the NRAS codon 61 mutation was associated with distant metastasis in patients with FTC.\nThe presence of a RAS mutation, especially a NRAS codon 61 mutation, was significantly associated with the distant metastasis. The NRAS codon 61 mutation status might be a potential prognostic factor in FTC patients.","title":"NRAS codon 61 mutation is associated with distant metastasis in patients with follicular thyroid carcinoma.","pubmedId":"24820091"}
