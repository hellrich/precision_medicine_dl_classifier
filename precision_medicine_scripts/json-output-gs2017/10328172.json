However, the incidence of single and combined K-ras mutations in stool and pancreatic tissue is unknown, and it is not clear whether detection of the K-ras oncogene in stool could be employed in screening tests.\nStool and pancreatic tissue of patients with ductal adenocarcinoma (n \u003d 36), cystadenocarcinoma (n \u003d 1), periampullary carcinoma (n \u003d 7), endocrine tumour (n \u003d 2) and chronic pancreatitis (CP, n \u003d 5) were analysed for mutated K-ras sequences prospectively. DNA of stool and pancreatic tissue was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and K-ras status was analysed by hybridisation.\nK-ras mutations were detected in the pancreatic tissue of 28 patients with ductal adenocarcinoma (78%), in 1 patient with cystadenocarcinoma, in 1 patient with periampullary carcinoma (14%) and in 1 patient with CP (20%). In 1 patient with an endocrine tumour, no K-ras mutations were diagnosed. K-ras mutations were detected in stool in 7 patients with ductal adenocarcinoma (20%), in 1 patient with cystadenocarcinoma and in 2 patients with CP (40%). Sensitivity of K-ras mutations for pancreatic cancer was 78% in tissue and 20% in stool.\nK-ras mutations lack specificity to discriminate malignant pancreatic disease from chronic inflammation in tissue and stool.","title":"K-ras mutations in tissue and stool samples from patients with pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis.","pubmedId":"10328172"}
