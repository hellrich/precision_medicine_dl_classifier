We reviewed 66 patients treated with either surgery and/or radiotherapy (n \u003d 41), radiation therapy and chemotherapy (n \u003d 11), combined modality treatment with surgery (n \u003d 8) or with management delayed to proven disease (n \u003d 6). The male-to-female ratio was 5.6 to 1, and the median age was 64 years (range, 15-89 years). Intercurrent death-corrected 5-year survival was 50%. The most important prognostic factors were M category and involvement of supraclavicular nodes. Primary tumor was eventually discovered in 12 patients during follow-up, 6 of whom received treatment with curative intent. The most common site of primary tumor was found to be the lung (n \u003d 5).","title":"Cervical metastasis from the unknown primary tumor.","pubmedId":"7546677"}
