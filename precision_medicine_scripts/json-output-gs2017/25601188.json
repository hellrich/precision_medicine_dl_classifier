However, standard therapeutic strategies for relapsed-SCLC remain unestablished. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression correlates with poor prognosis in extensive disease-SCLC. We have reported previously that HER2 expression is upregulated when HER2-positive SCLC cells acquire chemoresistance, and also demonstrated that trastuzumab exerts significant antitumor activity toward HER2-upregulated chemoresistant SCLC, mainly via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity mechanism. Based on these preclinical data, we treated two patients with HER2-positive SCLC by combination of trastuzumab (6 mg/kg, day 1) and irinotecan (80 mg/m(2), days 1 and 8) every 21 days as the third-line chemotherapy following two prior regimens, first-line carboplatin plus etoposide and second-line amrubicin. One patient achieved partial response after the first cycle and received 6 cycles in total without disease progression for 4.5 months. The other also received 4 cycles and kept stable disease for 3.5 months. This treatment can be continued safely at an outpatient clinic without any severe adverse event. In conclusion, trastuzumab plus irinotecan chemotherapy is promising and feasible against HER2-positive relapsed SCLC. Further clinical studies are encouraged to confirm the antitumor efficacy of trastuzumab in SCLC.","title":"Favorable response to trastuzumab plus irinotecan combination therapy in two patients with HER2-positive relapsed small-cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"25601188"}
