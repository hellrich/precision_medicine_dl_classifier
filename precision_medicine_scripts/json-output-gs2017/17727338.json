Samples were also examined for RET/PTC rearrangements. The results were compared with the cytological diagnosis and histopathology.\n13/156 cytological examinations were diagnostic for PTC and 19/156 showed suspicious/indeterminate FNAB (12.2%). FNAB-BRAF(V600E) mutation was detected in 11/16 (69%) cases with histological confirmation of PTC. In our series, RET/PTC rearrangement was detected in only one case of PTC, whereas it was not present in any case of adenoma, goiter, or Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis. No PTC case was found positive at the same time for BRAF mutation and RET/PTC rearrangements.\nBRAF(V600E) mutation detected on FNAB specimens, more than RET/PTC rearrangements, is highly specific for PTC and its routine research might well be an adjunctive and integrative diagnostic tool for the preoperative diagnostic iter.","title":"Fine-needle aspiration molecular analysis for the diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma through BRAF V600E mutation and RET/PTC rearrangement.","pubmedId":"17727338"}
