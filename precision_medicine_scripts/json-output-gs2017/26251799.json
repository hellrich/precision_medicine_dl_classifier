Reconstruction of the resulting bone defect is typically achieved with a nonnative implant that can result in poor cosmesis, foreign body reaction, or infection. Extracorporeal irradiation and reimplantation of tumorous bone has been used for limb-sparing surgery with excellent results, but this treatment option is not routinely considered in meningioma surgery. We present a case of anterior fossa meningioma with tumorous overlying calvarium that was successfully managed with intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation and reimplantation. Design, Setting, and Participant窶ア 37-year-old woman with persistent chronic headaches was found to have an anterior skull base meningioma with extension into the forehead frontal bone. Concurrently with mass resection, the bone flap was irradiated intraoperatively with 120 Gy. After resection of the tumor, the bone flap was replaced in its native position. Main Outcome Measures and Results窶サwenty-nine months postoperatively, the patient had an excellent cosmetic outcome with no radiographic evidence of tumor recurrence or significant bone flap resorption. Conclusion窶オntraoperative extracorporeal irradiation of tumorous calvaria during meningioma surgery is an effective, logistically feasible treatment option to achieve local tumor control and excellent cosmetic outcome.
