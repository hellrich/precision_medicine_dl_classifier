Altered gene expressions due to genetic polymorphisms in the BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51, and HER2 contribute toward the development of breast cancer, and yet, no such type of study has been conducted in the Bangladeshi population. This study was designed to evaluate the role of BRCA1rs80357713, BRCA1rs80357906, BRCA2rs11571653, RAD51rs1801320, and HER2rs1136201 polymorphisms as risk factors in the development of breast cancer in the Bangladeshi population.\nA total 310 patients with invasive breast cancers were recruited as cases from different public and private hospitals of Bangladesh, and 250 Bangladeshi healthy women matching age with the patients were recruited as controls. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method was used to analyze the genetic polymorphisms.\nPatients carrying BRCA1/2 mutations, GC and GC plus CC genotypes of RAD51rs1801320, and AG plus GG genotype of HER2rs1136201 polymorphisms were found to be associated with breast cancer. In subgroup analysis, AG plus GG genotype of HER2rs1136201 was found to be associated with the breast cancer risk in the patients younger than 45 years of age compared with the older patients having more than 45 years of age, and RAD51rs1801320 was related to the tumor size and tumor aggressiveness (higher graded tumor).\nOur results indicate that BRCA1/BRCA2, RAD51rs1801320 and HER2rs1136201 polymorphisms were associated with breast cancer in the studied population.","title":"Association of BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51, and HER2 gene polymorphisms with the breast cancer risk in the Bangladeshi population.","pubmedId":"27068824"}
