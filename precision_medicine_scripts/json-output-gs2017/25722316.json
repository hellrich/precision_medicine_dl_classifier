We report a case of a man with a giant liver mass at computed tomography scan. In September 1984, the patient had undergone resection of a duodenal tumor, diagnosed as schwannoma. A liver biopsy revealed a neoplasm composed of epithelioid and spindled cells, immunohistochemically positive to c-kit and Dog-1. Reexamining the duodenal tumor resected in 1984, it was reclassified as GIST. Sequencing revealed the same mutation of the c-kit gene in both duodenal and hepatic lesions. To the best of our knowledge, this case represents the longest disease-free interval between a primary GIST and its metastasis. A brief review of the literature and an analysis of the potential prognostic role of particular c-kit mutations are also provided.
