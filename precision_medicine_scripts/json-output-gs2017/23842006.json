We therefore performed a search in PubMed to get an update. This literature review comprises immunohistochemical studies on the clinical significance of c-erbB2/HER2 overexpression in gliomas, medulloblastomas, and meningiomas. In general, the findings were discrepant with regard to correlations between overexpression, tumor grade, and prognosis. Use of various antibodies may be a contributing factor to these discrepancies. Standardization of the immunohistochemical procedures is a relevant topic for discussion.
