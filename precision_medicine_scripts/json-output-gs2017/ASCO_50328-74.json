TNM staging system includes in stage IV all pts with metastases (METs), but its prognostic role according to METs site is unknown. Our aim was to evaluate accuracy of TNM to predict clinical outcome in stage IV dETs. Methods: Retrospective analysis of single-center dETs database. Inclusion of stage IV sporadic pancreatic ETs (PETs) and intestinal carcinoids (CTs) divided in: group 1, limited to the liver  5 METs; group 2, limited to the liver \u003e 5 METs; group 3, extra-abdominal METs. Prognostic factors and survival (svv) assessed to determine clinical outcome. Results: 47/269 (17.4%) pts excluded (missing information or MEN-I syndrome). 94/222 (42.3%) pts included: 49% female, median age 53 yrs (range 21-77). 47% PETs and 53% CTs, median size 3 cm (0.8-12). According to TNM, they were: T1 3%; T2 30%; T3 20%, T4 47%, N1 64%, all M1. 30% group 1, 63% group 2, 7% group 3. Median Ki67 4% (1%-95%). According to G grading system, 42% G1 (Ki67  2%), 43,5% G2 (Ki67 3%-20%), 14,5% G3 (Ki67 \u003e 20%). Significant risk factors for svv: PETs vs. CTs (HR 3,8; 95%CI 1.7-8.4; p \u003c 0.001), G3 vs. G1 (HR 10.0; 95%CI 3,4-29,5; p \u003c 0.001), G2 vs. G1 (HR 1.44; 95%CI 0.5-3.8; p \u003d 0.472), group 3 vs. 1 (HR 28.4; 95%CI 3.3-243.8; p \u003d 0.02), group 2 vs. 1 (HR 2.3; 95%CI 0.9-5.9; p \u003d 0.06), group 3 vs. 2 (HR 5.2; 95%CI 1.8-14.6; p \u003d 0.001). Overall 5-yr svv: 67%. Different svv for: primary site (p \u003c 0.001; 5-yr svv PETs/CTs: 45%/84%), G (p \u003c 0.001; 5-yr svv G1/G2/G3: 81%/67%/10%), disease spread (p \u003c 0.001; 5-yr svv group 1/2/3: 85%/63%/28%). Conclusions: In this set of dETs, 42.3% were stage IV at diagnosis. TNM could be improved identifying 3 subgroups with different prognosis (only liver METs,  5 / only liver METs, \u003e 5/extra-abdominal METs). Primary tumor site, G and disease extent are significant risk factors for svv.","title":"Accuracy of TNM staging system in prognostic stratification of stage IV digestive endocrine tumors.","pubmedId":"ASCO_50328-74"}
