On CT scanning, intraparenchymal sylvian meningioma was iso- or slightly hyper-dense masses. On MR imaging, tumors showed iso- or hypo- intense signal on T1WI and hyperintense signal on T2WI. After contrast enhancement, T1-weighted images revealed well-demarcated enhancing masses and intimately associated with the middle cerebral artery and its branches in the sylvian fissure. All the patients underwent craniotomy.\nAs a rare disease with radiographic characteristics similar to those of general meningiomas, intraparenchymal sylvian fissure meningioma does not adhere to the dura matter but adhere to or even encase the middle cerebral artery and its branches in the sylvian fissure. All of the above have differential values. During the surgical procedures, a proper handling of tumor and encompassed main trunk of middle cerebral artery and its branches is crucial to patient prognosis.","title":"[Diagnosis and surgical treatment of intraparenchymal sylvian fissure meningioma].","pubmedId":"20095360"}
