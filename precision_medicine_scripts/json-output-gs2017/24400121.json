Here we used computational methods to predict microRNAs relevant in breast cancer progression. Specifically, we applied different microRNA target prediction algorithms to various groups of differentially expressed protein-coding genes obtained from four breast cancer datasets. Six potential candidates were identified, among them miR-223, previously described to be highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment and known to be actively transferred into breast cancer cells. To investigate the function of miR-223 in tumorigenesis and to define its molecular mechanism, we overexpressed miR-223 in breast cancer cells in a transient or stable manner. Alternatively we overexpressed miR-223 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts or HEK293 cells and used their conditioned medium to treat tumor cells. With both approaches, we obtained elevated levels of miR-223 in tumor cells and observed decreased migration, increased cell death in anoikis conditions and augmented sensitivity to chemotherapy but no effect on adhesion and proliferation. The analysis of miR-223 predicted targets revealed enrichment in cell death and survival-related genes and in pathways frequently altered in breast cancer. Among these genes, we showed that protein levels for STAT5A, ITGA3 and NRAS were modulated by miR-223. In addition, we proved that STAT5A is a direct miR-223 target and highlighted a possible correlation between miR-223 and STAT5A in migration and chemotherapy response. Our investigation revealed that a computational analysis of cancer gene expression datasets can be a relevant tool to identify microRNAs involved in cancer progression and that miR-223 has a prominent role in breast malignancy that could potentially be exploited therapeutically.
