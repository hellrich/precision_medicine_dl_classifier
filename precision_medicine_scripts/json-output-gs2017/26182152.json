Case 1, a 67-year-old Japanese female developed tongue cancer 53 months after a pylorus-preserving Whipple resection for pancreatic head adenocarcinoma. Case 2, a 66-year-old female developed multiple breast cancers 52 months after a pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic head adenocarcinoma. Case 3, a 59-year-old male developed an adenocarcinoma in the remnant pancreatic head 63 months after a distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic body cancer. Case 4, a 68-year-old male developed lung cancer 92 months after a Whipple procedure for pancreatic head adenocarcinoma. Gemcitabine was administered to three patients as adjuvant chemotherapy at an average administrated dose of 38,199 mg per body surface area. Since primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is aggressive and always associated with a devastating outcome, metachronous double cancer is scarcely seen. All four cases received curative-intent surgery for each metachronous cancer and were alive for at least 20 months.
