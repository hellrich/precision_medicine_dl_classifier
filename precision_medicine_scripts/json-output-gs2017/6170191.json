Therefore, it is justified to carry out total gastrectomy or upper gastric resection as an ultimate palliation in advanced gastric cancer. 214 patients with advanced gastric cancer have undergone such a palliative treatment. The results of these patients, including operative mortality, survival rate and quality of life, will be compared with the results of those patients who underwent other kinds of palliation such as gastroenterostomy, oesophageal intubation, Witzel fistula. A special designed spiral tuber for the treatment of stenosed and inoperable cardiac and oesophageal carcinoma will be described.","title":"[Surgical therapy of advanced gastric cancer (author\u0027s transl)].","pubmedId":"6170191"}
