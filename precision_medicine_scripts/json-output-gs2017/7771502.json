A 41-year-old woman with a spinal cord meningioma first diagnosed 5 years previously with 3 recurrences in the spinal cord resulting in 4 neurosurgical procedures was admitted with a serum glucose of 23 mg/dL. Six months before the current admission, the patient was noted to have an abdominal mass of 10 cm not present on previous computed tomography. Three months later, the mass was 15.2 cm, and on the current admission, had increased to 23 cm and encased both the aorta and inferior vena cava. A needle biopsy of this mass before referral to the authors\u0027 hospital with hypoglycemia revealed that it was a meningioma. Evaluation of the etiology of the hypoglycemia, which required continuous intravenous glucose therapy, revealed that circulating insulin, C-peptide (i.e., connecting peptide), insulin-like growth factor-I (i.e., somatomedin-C) and insulin-like growth factor-II were all normal or low. Serum cortisol also was not low. Based on her endocrine evaluation, the hypoglycemia was secondary to the large mass of tumor cells, requiring a large glucose uptake to sustain its growth. After radiation therapy of 3,770 CGy to the meningioma, the patient became euglycemic without glucose supplementation.","title":"Case report: hypoglycemia secondary to a meningioma.","pubmedId":"7771502"}
