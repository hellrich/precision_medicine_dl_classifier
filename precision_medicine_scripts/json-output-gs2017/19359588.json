We have shown that tumor-derived IDH1 mutations impair the enzyme\u0027s affinity for its substrate and dominantly inhibit wild-type IDH1 activity through the formation of catalytically inactive heterodimers. Forced expression of mutant IDH1 in cultured cells reduces formation of the enzyme product, alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG), and increases the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor subunit HIF-1alpha, a transcription factor that facilitates tumor growth when oxygen is low and whose stability is regulated by alpha-KG. The rise in HIF-1alpha levels was reversible by an alpha-KG derivative. HIF-1alpha levels were higher in human gliomas harboring an IDH1 mutation than in tumors without a mutation. Thus, IDH1 appears to function as a tumor suppressor that, when mutationally inactivated, contributes to tumorigenesis in part through induction of the HIF-1 pathway.","title":"Glioma-derived mutations in IDH1 dominantly inhibit IDH1 catalytic activity and induce HIF-1alpha.","pubmedId":"19359588"}
