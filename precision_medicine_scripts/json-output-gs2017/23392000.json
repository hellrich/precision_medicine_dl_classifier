Mixed effects or longitudinal logistic models were used to determine whether the intervention affected change in sun protection habits, skin examinations, and perception and beliefs related to melanoma risk, prevention, and genetic counseling.\nAll participants in the intervention group who attended genetic counseling sessions chose to receive their test results. From baseline to follow-up, participants in the intervention group reported an increase in the frequency of skin self-examinations compared with a slight decrease in the control group (P \u003d 0.002). Participants in the intervention group reported a smaller decrease in frequency of wearing a shirt with long sleeves than did participants in the control group (P \u003d 0.047). No effect of the intervention was noted for other outcomes.\nFeedback of CDKN2A and MC1R genotype among families without known pathogenic CDKN2A mutations does not seem to decrease sun protection behaviors.\nWhile disclosure of CDKN2A and MC1R genotype did not have negative effects on prevention, the benefits of communicating this information remain unclear. The small number of families who tested positive for CDKN2A mutations in this study is a limitation.","title":"Melanoma genetic testing, counseling, and adherence to skin cancer prevention and detection behaviors.","pubmedId":"23392000"}
