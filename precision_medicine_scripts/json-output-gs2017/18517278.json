Myxoid and round cell liposarcomas are characterized by t(12;16)(q13; p11) or t(12;22)(q13;q12) translocations. Amplifications occur within the 12q13-15 region of atypical lipomatous tumors and well-differentiated liposarcomas but not lipomas.\nTo investigate the performance characteristics of the LSI CHOP Breakapart Rearrangement Probe for the diagnosis of myxoid/round cell liposarcomas and atypical lipomas/well-differentiated liposarcomas.\nWe investigated a series of lipomatous neoplasms (5 lipomas, 5 well-differentiated liposarcomas, 22 myxoid/round cell liposarcomas, 2 liposarcomas not otherwise specified, and 2 dedifferentiated liposarcomas) and normal myometrium for abnormalities in the q13-15 region of chromosome 12. Cases were studied for the presence or absence of t(12;16)(q13;p11) or t(12;22)(q13;q12) translocations by the LSI CHOP Breakapart Rearrangement Probe. These probes contain a sequence encompassing the SAS and CDK4 genes. Four or more copies of this sequence were considered to represent amplification of these genes.\nRearrangement of the CHOP gene was seen in all evaluable myxoid liposarcomas. Rearrangements were seen in 1 dedifferentiated liposarcoma but not in normal myometrium or lipomas. Probe signal amplification was seen in all 5 well-differentiated liposarcomas and 1 myxoid liposarcoma. No signal amplification was seen in lipomas or myometrium.\nDemonstration of translocations t(12; 16)(q13;p11) and t(12;22)(q13;q12) by the LSI CHOP Breakapart Rearrangement Probe appears to correlate with round cell/myxoid liposarcoma. The probe also demonstrated amplification of the 12q13-15 region in well-differentiated liposarcomas, making it useful for the diagnosis of these neoplasms. In a significant percentage of cases, high background fluorescence or poor probe staining made interpretation difficult.","title":"Translocations and amplifications of chromosome 12 in liposarcoma demonstrated by the LSI CHOP breakapart rearrangement probe.","pubmedId":"18517278"}
