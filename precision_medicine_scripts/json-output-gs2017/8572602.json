Asia. Upto 95% of all malignant gastric neoplasms are adenocarcinomata, but other types of gastric cancer have evoked considerable interest in the literature. Genetic factors have been suspected of playing a pivotal role in the etiology of gastric cancer but no clear inheritance pattern has emerged and environmental influences remain the focus of many current theories of pathogenesis. Current evidence implicates the non-random involvement of certain chromosomes and related oncogenes especially Ras and p53. Genes that may predispose to gastric cancer have not been clearly implicated but some studies indicate a familial aggregation of gastric cancer. The objective of this review is to reappraise the role of genetics in the etiology of gastric cancer with special reference to relevant information for practicing clinicians.","title":"Genetics of gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"8572602"}
