For ovarian cancer, the known highly penetrant susceptibility genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) are probably responsible for only 40% of the excess familial ovarian cancer risks, suggesting that other susceptibility genes of lower penetrance exist. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of SNPs in three genes, XRCC2 (R188H), ERCC2 (K751Q) and CDKN1B (V109G) which are with moderate risk for ovarian cancer susceptibility in Egyptian women. We further investigated the potential combined effect of these genes variants on ovarian cancer risk. The three genes polymorphisms were characterized in 100 ovarian cancer Egyptian females and 100 healthy women by (RFLP-PCR) method in a case control study. Our results revealed that the frequencies of AC genotypes of ERCC2 (K751Q), and GG genotypes of CDKN1B (V109G) polymorphisms were significantly higher in EOC patients than in normal individual (P \u003d 0.007, 0.02 respectively). The frequencies of AA genotype of XRCC2 (R188H) and CC genotype of ERCC2 (K751Q) were higher in EOC patients than in normal individual but without significance (P \u003d 0.06, 0.38 respectively). Also, no association between any one of the three studied genes polymorphisms and the clinical characteristics of disease. The combination of GA (XRCC2) + AC (ERCC2) + GG (CDKN1B) was significantly associated with increased EOC risk. Also, the combination for GA (XRCC2) + AC (ERCC2) and the combination of AA (XRCC2) + CC (ERCC2) were significantly associated with increased EOC risk. There was significant difference in CA125 values between EOC and control Group (P \u003c 0.001). Our results suggested that, XRCC2, ERCC2 and CDKN1B genes are important candidate genes for susceptibility to EOC. Also, gene-gene interaction between GA (XRCC2) + AC (ERCC2) + GG (CDKN1B) polymorphism may be associated with increased risk of EOCC in Egyptian women.","title":"Role of DNA repair and cell cycle control genes in ovarian cancer susceptibility.","pubmedId":"23277402"}
