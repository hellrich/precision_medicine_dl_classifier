The EGFR gene type was determined through pyrosequencing assay. The factors associated with EGFR gene mutation were explored by comparing their clinicopathological features.\nAmong them, 313 (46.2%) patients had mutant EGFR. It happened more frequently in females (60.4% vs 33.3%), non-smoker (54.8% vs 32.4%), stagesIa-IIIa (51.1% vs 38.6%), well-differentiated (81.1% vs 46.1%) and adenocarcinoma (50.7% vs 15.3%) patients than in males, smoker, stages IIIb-IV, poorly differentiated and non-adenocarcinoma counterparts (all P \u003c 0.05). However, the mutation rate was lower in patients with AB blood type (25.0%) than those with other blood types (type A 49.4%, type B 46.0%, type O 50.0%) (all P \u003c 0.05). The patients with mutant EGFR gene had a higher level of serum carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) than those with wild-type EGFR gene (114.5 vs 41.8 Âµg/L, P \u003d 0.038).\nThe female, non-smoker, stagesIa-IIIa, well-differentiated and adenocarcinoma patients of NSCLC have significantly higher incidence of EGFR gene mutation while mutation is rare in those with AB blood type. And pathology, differentiation and blood type are independent factors affecting EGFR mutation.","title":"[Clinicopathological features associated with EGFR gene mutation in non-small cell lung cancer patients].","pubmedId":"25399972"}
