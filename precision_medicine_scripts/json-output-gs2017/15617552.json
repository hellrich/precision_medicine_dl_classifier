However, as no cases of PJS with GC in which a STK11 germline mutation has been identified have ever been reported and other susceptibility genes have also been suggested to be involved in PJS, the relation between STK11 germline mutations and GC in PJS is still unknown. In this study, we used sequencing analysis to investigate the STK11, CDH1, and TP53 loci for a germline mutation in two siblings with PJS with primary GC. A novel type of the STK11 germline mutation, c.890delG, encoding a truncated protein (p.Arg297fsX38) was identified, but no germline mutations of the CDH1 and TP53 genes were detected. No inactivation of the wild-type allele by somatic mutation or chromosomal deletion or hypermethylation at the 5\u0027-CpG site of STK11 was detected in the GC. This is the first report of a STK11 germline mutation in a PJS patient with GC and should contribute to establishing correlations between the STK11 germline mutations and GC in PJS patients.","title":"A novel STK11 germline mutation in two siblings with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome complicated by primary gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"15617552"}
