Epithelioid glioblastomas usually occur as primary lesions, but there have been several reports of secondary epithelioid glioblastomas or epithelioid glioblastomas with pre- or co-existing lesions to date. The serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf (BRAF) V600E mutation has been found at a high frequency of 54% in epithelioid glioblastomas. We present a case of a 26-year-old female patient with an epithelioid glioblastoma with the BRAF V600E mutation in her right frontal lobe. In the present case, a low-grade diffuse astrocytoma component had colocalized with the epithelioid glioblastoma. The component presented prominent calcification on neuroimages as well as by histology, and low-grade diffuse astrocytoma was considered to be a precursor lesion of an epithelioid glioblastoma. However, the BRAF V600E mutation was detected only in epithelioid glioblastoma but not in low-grade diffuse astrocytoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating a discrepancy in the BRAF V600E mutation states between epithelioid glioblastoma and colocalized low-grade astrocytoma.
