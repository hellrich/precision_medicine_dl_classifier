Recently, a tumor suppressor function for the lipid phosphatase inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B) has been described in breast and prostate cancers, with impact on PI3K signaling output. Given the importance of PI3K pathway activity for melanoma formation and growth, we aimed to assess the role of INPP4B in melanocytic tumors. Our studies in native tumors suggest that decreased INPP4B expression is an event correlating with tumor progression in melanocytic neoplasms. We further demonstrate that INPP4B regulates PI3K/Akt signaling and exerts a tumor suppressor effect, impacting the proliferative, invasive, and tumorigenic capacity of melanoma cells. INPP4B expression in melanocytic neoplasms may therefore have potential as a biomarker for disease progression and as a modulator for the prediction of treatment outcome.
