Their proper recognition is important clinically because of their potential responsiveness to targeted therapies. We report a case of duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumor with a highly unusual epithelioid morphology that had an appearance reminiscent of a steroid producing neoplasm, such as an adrenal cortical neoplasm or, alternatively, a renal cell carcinoma variant. The recognition of the current tumor as a duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumor was prompted by its apparent location in the duodenal wall. Ancillary immunohistochemical and molecular sequence analyses were necessary to confirm the diagnosis as a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The current case illustrates the importance of considering gastrointestinal stromal tumor in the differential diagnosis of any epithelioid tumors in the gastrointestinal tract or the abdominal-pelvic cavity.","title":"Duodenal epithelioid gastrointestinal stromal tumor with prominent granular cell features.","pubmedId":"19121840"}
