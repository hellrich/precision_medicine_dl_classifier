Five corresponded to previously isolated genes, while one (Lc19) matched with the sequence of an unannotated EST. Real-time RT-PCR analyses of expression levels in a panel of 34 paired primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and corresponding grossly normal appearing lung tissues confirmed the common overexpression of these genes in non-small cell lung cancer. Among these genes, overexpression of Lc19, hyaluronan binding protein 2 (HABP2) and crystalline-mu appeared more specific to adenocarcinoma, whereas ceruloplasmin, integrin alpha-11 and collagen type XI alpha 1 were overexpressed at high frequency among both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. These genes represent novel candidate tumor biomarker genes for NSCLC and its histological subtypes.","title":"Novel candidate tumor marker genes for lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"12386823"}
