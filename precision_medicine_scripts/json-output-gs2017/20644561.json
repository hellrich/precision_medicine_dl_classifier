However, tumor response to chemoradiation varies widely among individuals and cannot be determined before the final pathologic evaluation. The aim of this study was to identify germline genetic markers that could predict sensitivity or resistance to preoperative radiochemotherapy (RT-CT) in rectal cancer. We evaluated the predictive value of 128 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 71 patients preoperatively treated by RT-CT. The selected SNPs were distributed over 76 genes that are involved in various cellular processes such as DNA repair, apoptosis, proliferation or immune response. The SNPs superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) rs4880 (P\u003d0.005) and interleukin-13 (IL13) rs1800925 (P\u003d0.0008) were significantly associated with tumor response to chemoradiation. These results reinforce the idea of using germline polymorphisms for personalized treatment.","title":"A large-scale candidate gene approach identifies SNPs in SOD2 and IL13 as predictive markers of response to preoperative chemoradiation in rectal cancer.","pubmedId":"20644561"}
