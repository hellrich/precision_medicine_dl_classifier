Eligibility criteria included nonresectable locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and measurable disease. Gemcitabine at 1,000 mg/m(2) and leucovorin at 20 mg/m(2) were administered intravenously 30 minutes before 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m(2), weekly for 3 of every 4 weeks. Twenty nine patients were enrolled. The overall response rate was 21% (95% confidence interval: 8% to 40%), consisting of one complete response and five partial responses; 16 patients (55%) had stable disease. Median survival was 8.4 months (95% confidence interval: 2.6 to 14.2), and actuarial 1-year survival was 36%. Neutropenia (grade 3 only) was reported in 3.4% of patients, but was generally of short duration. No thrombocytopenia or evidence of cumulative myelosuppression was observed. The only significant nonhematologic events were grade 3 diarrhea and alopecia (both 3.4%). Gemcitabine plus 5-fluorouracil is active and well tolerated compared with results reported for each of these single agents. Thus, this combination justifies future comparative clinical trials.
