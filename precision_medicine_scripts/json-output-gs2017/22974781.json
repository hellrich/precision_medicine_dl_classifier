Early-stage NSCLC is managed primarily by surgical resection, with adjuvant chemotherapy for selected patients with stage IB, II, and III disease. Patients with locally advanced stage III NSCLC are usually treated with combined modality therapy. Advanced NSCLC remains an incurable disease. Further advances will rely on improvements in understanding of the molecular events driving the malignant phenotype and the development of novel, targeted therapeutic strategies.","title":"Treatment of lung cancer.","pubmedId":"22974781"}
