These appearances provide a normal data base from which to interpret subtle changes in early neoplasia.\nThirteen women of reproductive age with clinically and cytologically normal cervices were imaged with a ring-design solenoid receiver coil that was placed intravaginally and enveloped the cervix. T1- and T2-weighted axial images were obtained. Seven uterine specimens resected for benign disease were similarly studied, and imaging appearances were correlated with histologic findings.\nIn the in vivo studies, the endocervical mucosa and two stromal zones surrounding the high-signal central canal were identified. Unlike the uterine body, they could be differentiated on both T1- and T2-weighted images, on which the inner ring had a low signal and the outer ring had an intermediate signal intensity. The outer zone was highly vascularized, with inflow effects from large vessels visible on single-slice scans. On administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine, the endocervical mucosa enhanced rapidly, whereas the outer stroma showed more gradual enhancement. The inner zone enhanced slowly relative to the outer zone. The parametrium was visualized up to 6 cm from the center of the coil, and adjacent colon, fat, and blood vessels were identified. Up to four lymph nodes less than 1 cm in diameter were seen in the parametrium of three subjects. In the in vitro studies, the endocervical mucosa was of high signal intensity. In the fibromuscular cervix, an inner low-signal ring correlated with a region of tightly packed stroma (fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells; cell count, 5900 +/- 2376 nuclei/mm2) and the intermediate-signal-intensity outer zone corresponded to a region of more loosely packed stroma (cell count, 2199 +/- 558 nuclei/mm2). Retention cysts were present in two multiparous cervices.\nThese detailed appearances and enhancement patterns of the normal cervix need to be recognized so that subtle changes in locally invasive cervical neoplasia can be identified.","title":"The uterine cervix on in vitro and in vivo MR images: a study of zonal anatomy and vascularity using an enveloping cervical coil.","pubmedId":"8079853"}
