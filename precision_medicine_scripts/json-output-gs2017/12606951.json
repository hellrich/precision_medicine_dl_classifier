Here we report that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 12p was detected in approximately 50% of human lung adenocarcinomas and large cell carcinomas, and Kras2 mutations were detected at codon 12 in approximately 40% of adenocarcinomas and large cell carcinomas. Interestingly, all of the lung adenocarcinomas and large cell carcinomas containing a Kras2 mutation exhibited allelic loss of the wild-type Kras2 allele when a correlation between LOH of the region on chromosome 12p and Kras2 mutation was made. These results from human lung cancer tissues provide a strong evidence in support of our previous observation in mouse models that the wild-type Kras2 is a tumor suppressor of lung cancer.","title":"LOH of chromosome 12p correlates with Kras2 mutation in non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"12606951"}
