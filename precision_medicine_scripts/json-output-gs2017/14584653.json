Uterine artery and ureteral dissection with resection of the cervicovesical fascia, cardinal and uterosacral ligaments were successful with ultrasonically activated instruments only.\nOur initial experience with laparoscopically assisted radical vaginal hysterectomy type II confirmed that the use of a minimally invasive ultrasonic technique is feasible. Further investigations into the indications of disease where laparoscopic surgery is appropriate in the management of early cervical carcinoma are required.","title":"Laparoscopically assisted modified radical vaginal hysterectomy (type II) with pelvic lymphadenectomy: ultrasonic operative technique.","pubmedId":"14584653"}
