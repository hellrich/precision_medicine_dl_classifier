Consequently, therapeutic interventions which inhibit sympathetic nerve function are likely to favorably alter the natural course of the disease. Indeed, recent clinical studies have shown that treatment with carvedilol, a beta-blocker, reduces mortality and the risk of death and hospitalization. The therapeutic value of beta-blockers, however, may be limited by their propensity to cause acute hemodynamic deterioration which results from abrupt withdrawal of sympathetic support. Thus, although the introduction of beta-blockers represents an important advance in the treatment of CHF, a better tolerated means of modulating the sympathetic nervous system would be highly desirable. An alternative strategy for directly modulating sympathetic nerve function is to inhibit the biosynthesis of norepinephrine (NE) via inhibition of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of dopamine (DA) to NE in sympathetic nerves. This approach may have the following three merits over beta-blockade. First, this class of drugs would be expected to produce gradual modulation, as opposed to abrupt blockade, of sympathetic nerve function and, consequently, would not be associated with acute hemodynamic worsening thereby obviating the need for dose-titration. Second, from a theoretical standpoint, DBH inhibitors, at low doses, would preferentially inhibit NE release in the heart since the storage pool of NE in this organ is selectively depleted in CHF. Lastly, inhibition of DBH would augment the levels of DA which, via agonism of dopamine receptors, could have beneficial effects on renal function. Nepicastat is a novel, selective and potent (IC50 \u003d 9 nM) inhibitor of DBH. Preclinical studies have shown that nepicastal produces gradual modulation of catecholamine levels (reduction in NE and elevation of DA and DA/NE ratio) in cardiovascular tissues and plasma, attenuates sympathetically-mediated cardiovascular responses and also has salutary effects on renal function. In a canine heart failure model, normalization of transmyocardial norepinephrine balance with nepicastat retards the process of ventricular dilation and prevents progressive worsening of cardiac function. Early short-term clinical studies in CHF patients have shown that nepicastat is well tolerated and produces significant and dose-dependent increases in plasma DA/NE concentrations.","title":"Dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibition: a novel sympatho-modulatory approach for the treatment of congestive heart failure.","pubmedId":"10197057"}
