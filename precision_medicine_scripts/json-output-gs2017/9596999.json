In stimulated lymphocytes, we observed an early G1 accumulation (P \u003c 0.005), a delayed increase in the duration of S-phase (P \u003c 0.03), and a consequent increase in cell-cycle duration. The expression of several cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and CDK inhibitors (CKIs) was modified. Cyclin D3, CDK4, and CDK6 involved in G1-phase control were significantly decreased under dexamethasone treatment whatever the level of stimulation of lymphocytes (stimulated or unstimulated PBL). Cyclin E and CDK2, acting in G1/ S-phase transition and S-phase regulation, decreased in stimulated lymphocytes before any modification of S-phase (P \u003c 0.002). The expression of CKIs, mainly of p27Kip1, appeared to vary with the degree of cell stimulation: a decrease was observed on treated unstimulated lymphocytes, while p27Kip1 increased in dexamethasone-treated cells during stimulation. Our results indicate sequential modifications of the cell-cycle regulation by dexamethasone starting with an action on G1 followed by S-phase control modifications. The protein analysis pinpoints the major complexes concerned: CDK4 and CDK6/cyclin D are mainly involved in G1-phase modifications, while CDK2 and its partner, cyclin E, might be specifically involved in the lengthening of S-phase. The variations observed for p27Kip1 might amplify the functional effects of dexamethasone on kinasic complexes.","title":"Glucocorticoids induce G1 as well as S-phase lengthening in normal human stimulated lymphocytes: differential effects on cell cycle regulatory proteins.","pubmedId":"9596999"}
