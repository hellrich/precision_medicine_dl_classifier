The fusion proteins from the ALK gene have been identified in oncohaematology malignancies including ALK positive anaplastic lymphoma large cell and non small cells lung cancer with EML4-ALK fusion gene. Constitutive activation generated by modification of this protein leads activation of anti apoptotic and survey pathways that makes it a prime target for these 2 subtypes of disease. Strategies and therapeutic molecules targeting the fusion protein are under development and preliminary results are encouraging. Therefore the mapping of the tumors is essential to help provide treatment specific to each entity. The best example is the chronic myeloid leukemia and the discovery of the fusion gene bcr-abl and of imatinib.","title":"[Implications of ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) in oncohematology].","pubmedId":"20483705"}
