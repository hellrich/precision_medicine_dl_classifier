We investigated the activities of proteins that interact with KRAS in PDAC cells.\nWe used mass spectrometry to demonstrate that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (HNRNP) A2 and B1 (encoded by the gene HNRNPA2B1) interact with KRAS G12V. We used co-immunoprecipitation analyses to study interactions between HNRNPA2B1 and KRAS in KRAS-dependent and KRAS-independent PDAC cell lines. We knocked down HNRNPA2B1 using small hairpin RNAs and measured viability, anchorage-independent proliferation, and growth of xenograft tumors in mice. We studied KRAS phosphorylation using the Phos-tag system.\nWe found that interactions between HRNPA2B1 and KRAS correlated with KRAS-dependency of some human PDAC cell lines. Knock down of HNRNPA2B1 significantly reduced viability, anchorage-independent proliferation, and formation of xenograft tumors by KRAS-dependent PDAC cells. HNRNPA2B1 knock down also increased apoptosis of KRAS-dependent PDAC cells, inactivated c-akt murine thymoma oncogene homolog 1 signaling via mammalian target of rapamycin, and reduced interaction between KRAS and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase. Interaction between HNRNPA2B1 and KRAS required KRAS phosphorylation at serineÂ 181.\nIn KRAS-dependent PDAC cell lines, HNRNPA2B1 interacts with and regulates the activity of KRAS G12V and G12D. HNRNPA2B1 is required for KRAS activation of c-akt murine thymoma oncogene homolog 1-mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, interaction with phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase, and PDAC cell survival and tumor formation in mice. HNRNPA2B1 might be a target for treatment of pancreatic cancer.","title":"Ribonucleoprotein HNRNPA2B1 interacts with and regulates oncogenic KRAS in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells.","pubmedId":"24998203"}
