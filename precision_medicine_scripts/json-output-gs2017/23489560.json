Recent developments in cancer genome sequencing technology expanded our knowledge of driver mutations, which were identified as novel candidates for targeted therapy in various cancers. Successful targeted treatments for lung adenocarcinoma, NSCLC\u0027s primary subtype, with EGFR mutation or ALK fusion are clinically available, and a clinical trial of personalized targeted therapy in patients with lung adenocarcinoma is underway by the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium. Although there are targeted treatments for lung adenocarcinoma, no personalized therapies currently exist for SQCC. Recently, comprehensive genomic characterization of lung SQCC using massively parallel sequencing has enabled us to identify several potential driver mutations/signaling pathways. These are FGFR1 amplifications, PI3KCA mutations, PTEN mutations/deletions, PDGFRA amplifications/mutations, and DDR2 mutations. The march toward personalized therapy may have taken a step forward with the discovery of these potential biomarkers for the treatment of SQCC of the lung. This article reviewed the current knowledge of genomic landscape of lung SQCC and summarized ongoing clinical trials of targeted agents for lung SQCC. Also, we will suggest several other actionable mutations with matching drugs that should be investigated in future clinical trials for the personalized treatment of lung SQCC.","title":"Personalized therapy on the horizon for squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.","pubmedId":"23489560"}
