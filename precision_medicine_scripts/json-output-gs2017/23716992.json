The adenocarcinoma was determined to be the primary tumor based on the histological features. The GIST cells were diffusely and strongly positive for CD34 and CD117.\nThe patients were six men and two women aged 47-80 years (average, 68.6 years). GIST was preoperatively detected in only one patient. The average sizes of the gastric adenocarcinomas and GISTs were 6.000 ± 2.6186 cm and 1.825 ± 1.4370 cm, respectively. All GISTs were very low- or low-risk lesions that were detected during evaluation, staging, operation or follow-up for gastric adenocarcinoma.\nWe hypothesized that the stomach was influenced by the same unknown carcinogen, resulting in a simultaneous proliferation of different cell lines (epithelial and stromal cell).","title":"Synchronous adenocarcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors in the stomach.","pubmedId":"23716992"}
