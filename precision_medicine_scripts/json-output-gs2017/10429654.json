PJS is often accompanied by several malignancies, including breast tumor, adenoma malignum of the uterine cervix, and ovarian tumor. To investigate the involvement of STK11 gene in the development of ovarian carcinomas, we analyzed 30 ovarian carcinomas for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and STK11 gene mutations. We found one missense mutation (codon 281, Pro to Leu) with heterozygous and somatic status. This mutation occurred at codon 281, which lies within the mutational hot spot (codon 279-281) of STK11 gene previously reported in PJS. We also detected LOH in 2 (11%) of 19 informative ovarian carcinomas. Our results suggest that mutations of the STK11 gene may play a limited role in the development of ovarian carcinomas.","title":"Mutational analysis of STK11 gene in ovarian carcinomas.","pubmedId":"10429654"}
