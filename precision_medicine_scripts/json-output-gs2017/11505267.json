To our knowledge, only 43 cases of liposarcoma originating in the oral tissues have been reported in the English-language literature. In this article, we report a case of well-differentiated liposarcoma affecting the cheek of a 28-year-old man and review the oral liposarcoma literature. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor revealed an MDM2+/CDK4+/p53+ immunophenotype that is consistent with the immunohistochemical profile of well-differentiated liposarcoma originating in other areas of the body. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of the DNA levels of the MDM2 (human homologue of the murine double-minute type 2), CDK4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4), and SAS (sarcoma amplified sequence), genes was performed, revealing only SAS gene amplification. The possibility of misdiagnosis of oral liposarcoma because of its sometimes inconspicuous clinical and microscopic features is emphasized. Careful pathologic examination of liposarcoma is essential for discrimination from benign adipose tissue neoplasms and for precise histologic classification, both of major prognostic significance. Possible implications of molecular and cytogenetic analysis for unraveling the pathogenesis and determining the prognosis of liposarcoma are discussed.","title":"MDM2+/CDK4+/p53+ oral liposarcoma: case report and review of the literature.","pubmedId":"11505267"}
