Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations were detected in 132 cases (60.3%). Female patients and non-smokers had higher EGFR mutation rates (P \u003d 0.022 and 0.026, respectively). The lepidic, papillary, acinar, solid, micropapillary, and mucinous predominant patterns had EGFR mutation rates of 70.6%, 64.8%, 72.5%, 33.3%, 100%, and 5.9%, respectively. The exon mutation distribution differed according to serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels (P \u003d 0.018). v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations were detected in 20 cases (9.2%), and were frequently found in the mucinous and solid predominant subtypes. The serum CEA levels differed among the subtypes.\nIn China, there are significant differences between lung adenocarcinoma histologic subtypes. The presence of well-differentiated components in lung adenocarcinoma indicates higher EGFR mutation rates; the presence of solid or mucinous components indicates higher KRAS mutation rates. Serum CEA levels are associated with histologic subtype and EGFR exon mutations.","title":"Identification of lung adenocarcinoma mutation status based on histologic subtype: Retrospective analysis of 269 patients.","pubmedId":"26816535"}
