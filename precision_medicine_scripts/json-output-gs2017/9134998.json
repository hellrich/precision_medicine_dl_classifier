In comparison to normal pancreas, Southern blot analyses revealed amplification of the cyclin D1 coding gene in 25% of the cases, whereas with reverse transcription-PCR, overexpression of mRNA was observed in 82% of the examined tissues. Immunohistochemically, we could demonstrate nuclear overexpression in tumor cells in 68.4%, and this protein accumulation correlated significantly with poor prognosis [median survival, 18.1 versus 10.5 months; P \u003c 0.01 (chi2 test)].","title":"Overexpression of cyclin D1 in human pancreatic carcinoma is associated with poor prognosis.","pubmedId":"9134998"}
