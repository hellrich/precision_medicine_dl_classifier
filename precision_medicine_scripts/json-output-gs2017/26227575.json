The purpose of our study was to determine prevalence and clinical variables associated with somatic neuropathy applying a simple screening method.\nAll outpatients with type 2 diabetes attending our diabetic clinic were offered to participate into a diabetic foot screening program, in the period January 2004-December 2012. A total of 3,591 diabetic patients (55.5% men, age 68Â±10years) underwent detection of somatic neuropathy using the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument in its parts of symptoms (administering a questionnaire) and clinical assessment slightly modified (evaluating foot inspection, vibration sensation by biothesiometer, ankle reflexes).\nThe prevalence of somatic neuropathy was 2.2% in men and 5.5% in women (p\u003c0.001) when assessed by symptom questionnaire, whereas it was 30.5% in men and 30.8% (p\u003dNS) in women when identified by clinical assessment. In subjects with somatic neuropathy macro- and microvascular complications of diabetes were significantly more common. In multivariate logistic regression analyses BMI, HbA1c and ankle/brachial index independently predicted the presence of neuropathy.\nThe prevalence of somatic neuropathy in type 2 diabetes is nearly 30% when searched with clinical examination. Poor metabolic control, excess body weight and peripheral arteriopathy are independent markers of somatic neuropathy.","title":"Prevalence of neuropathy in type 2 diabetic patients and its association with other diabetes complications: The Verona Diabetic Foot Screening Program.","pubmedId":"26227575"}
