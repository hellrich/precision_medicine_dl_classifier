Gene signatures have provided improved prognostic indicators of human prostate cancer. The TGF-β/BMP-SMAD4 signaling pathway, which induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), is known to constrain prostate cancer progression induced by Pten deletion. Herein, cyclin D1 inactivation reduced cellular proliferation in the murine prostate in vivo and in isogenic oncogene-transformed prostate cancer cell lines. The in vivo cyclin D1-mediated molecular signature predicted poor outcome of recurrence-free survival for patients with prostate cancer (K-means HR, 3.75, P \u003d 0.02) and demonstrated that endogenous cyclin D1 restrains TGF-β, Snail, Twist, and Goosecoid signaling. Endogenous cyclin D1 enhanced Wnt and ES cell gene expression and expanded a prostate stem cell population. In chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, cyclin D1 occupied genes governing stem cell expansion and induced their transcription. The coordination of EMT restraining and stem cell expanding gene expression by cyclin D1 in the prostate may contribute to its strong prognostic value for poor outcome in biochemical-free recurrence in human prostate cancer.","title":"Identification of a cyclin D1 network in prostate cancer that antagonizes epithelial-mesenchymal restraint.","pubmedId":"24282282"}
