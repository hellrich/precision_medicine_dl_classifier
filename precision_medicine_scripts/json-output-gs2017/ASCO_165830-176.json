Little is known about the significance of genomic alterations that coexist with AKT1or become acquired in these tumors. To investigate these alterations, we sought tumor genotypes and their evolution before, during, and after Tx with an AKT inhibitor (AKTi). Here we report interim results from this ongoing study. Methods: Eligible pts at MSKCC had AKT1 E17K mutation (mut) positive (+) solid tumors and were enrolled to the multi-centre basket study (NCT01226316) of AZD5363, an oral catalytic pan-AKTi. AKT mut status was prospectively confirmed on archival or fresh tumor samples prior to enrollment. Serial plasma samples were collected for detection and tracking of the AKT1 E17K mut (expressed as the mutant allele fraction [MAFAKT ]) in cfDNA by allele-specific droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and exon capture NGS analysis of 410 genes (MSK-IMPACT). Tumor NGS was also performed on available pre-Tx and progression biopsy specimens. Results: From October 2014 to December 2015, 24 pts had cfDNA extracted from 82 plasma samples for NGS. Mean sequencing coverage was 436. cfDNA was AKT1 E17K mut +ve in 22/24 (92%) pts by ddPCR and NGS. MAFAKT by NGS and ddPCR was highly concordant (r\u003d 0.98; p\u003c2.2e-16). MAFAKT by ddPCR could be correlated with tumor response, with durable RECIST responses seen in 5/5 (100%) pts with persistent (\u003e21 days) cfDNA clearance. The most frequently mutated genes in addition to AKT1 were ESR1 (27%), TP53 (23%) and GATA3 (18%) with an average of 4 muts per pt. Pre-Tx cfDNA NGS revealed muts not observed in the archival specimen in 4/9 (44%) pts. 7 muts emerged on NGS of on-study and progression cfDNA, which were not observed or found at low abundance in pre-Tx cfDNA, including muts in GRIN2A, TP53 and CEBPA, among others. Second site muts in AKT1 were not observed. Conclusions: Serial NGS of cfDNA is feasible and highly concordant with ddPCR. Throughout therapy with an AKTi, the AKT1 E17K alteration appears to be clonal, however, serial NGS can identify emergent genomic alterations.
