There is a correlation between the activity of the enzyme, and the susceptibility to metastatic cancer, including metastatic melanoma. Melanoma of the skin were 1.4% of all cancers in men and the number of deaths from this cancer in Poland in 2002 was the 424th. The aim of the study was decided to determine the usefulness of arylsulfatase activity in patients with melanoma of men for diagnostic purposes and for monitoring of the disease course.\nThe study included 25 patients diagnosed men with melanoma (mean age 55.5 years). Blood samples were collected before excision of melanoma of the skin and in the period from 2 to 3 months after surgery. To donate blood after resection of malignant melanoma reported only 13 men (mean age 57.4 years). Arylsulfatase activity was determined by Roy the modified Bleszczynski method.\nArylsulfatase activity before surgery to remove the changes was higher in comparison to the control group and the patients after surgery.\nOf men patients with malignat melanoma arylsulfatase activity was high. Arylsulfatase mark may be useful in diagnosing and monitoring the course of the disease.","title":"[Arylsulfatase activity in the blood of men with malignat melanoma.
