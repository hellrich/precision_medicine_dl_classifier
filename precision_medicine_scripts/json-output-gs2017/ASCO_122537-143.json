{"genes":["mFOLFIRINOX"],"publicationTypes":["2014 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium"],"abstract":"Background:  FOLFIRINOX exhibits a meaningful improvement in outcome measures in metastatic pancreatic cancer, making it an interesting regimen for BRPC and LAURPC. However, its use remains prohibitive due to toxicity. In this study, we examine the outcomes of mFOLFIRINOX as a neoadjuvant strategy for patients with BRPC and LAURPC. Methods:  This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of patients who received mFOLFIRINOX for BRPC or LAURPC at Ohio State University. mFOLFIRINOX is as follows: irinotecan at 165 mg/m2; oxaliplatin at 85 mg/m2; 5-fluorouracil (5FU) at 2,400 mg/m2 over 46 hours and  pegfilgrastim on day 4 of each 2-week cycle. Cases were thoroughly reviewed by a multidisciplinary team prior to initiation of therapy and at each restaging scan. The primary outcomes of this analysis were resection rate and grade 3/4 (G3/4) toxicities.  Results:  Since 1/1/2011, 43 patients (20 BRPC; 23 LAURPC) have received mFOLFIRINOX. Patients received gemcitabine-based chemoradiation (36 Gy in 15 fractions) only if their best response was stable disease after 4 months of mFOLFIRINOX.  At the time of this abstract, 39 patients are evaluable for primary outcome.  Overall resection rate was 53.8% including 45% of patients with initially unresectable disease. R0 resection was achieved in 85.7% of the surgeries. See table for more results. The rate of G3/4 toxicity was remarkably low with no episodes of febrile neutropenia, G3/4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Toxicities lead to dose reductions in 46% of patients. Conclusions:  Neoadjuvant mFOLFIRINOX is an effective, well-tolerated regimen as part of an integrated, multimodality strategy in BRPC and LAURPC leading to high resection rates and high R0 resection frequency.All patients (n \u003d 43)Age, median (yo)65 (range: 40-81)ECOG 0-1 (%)100%BRPC, n20LAURPC, n23Median # of cycles:4 (range: 1-10)Evaluable patients (n \u003d 39)Overall resection rate53.8%Median PFSResected18.4 monthsUnresected9.2 months (log-rank p-value \u003c0.001)BRPC (n\u003d19)LAURPC (n\u003d20)Received chemo/XRT, n (%)10 (52.6%)13 (65%)Achieved resection, n (%)Overall12 (63.2%)9 (45%)R010 (52.6%)8 (40%)","title":"Tolerability and efficacy of modified FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX) in patients with borderline-resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) and locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer (LAURPC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_122537-143"}
