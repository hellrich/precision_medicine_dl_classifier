Pearson\u0027s correlation and multiple regression analyses were used to examine the possible symptom cluster.\nDepression, fatigue, pain, and QOL.\nDepression, fatigue, and pain were found in a majority of survivors, with pain being the least common symptom. Fatigue was the most intense of the three symptoms. Two significantly correlated symptoms were depression and fatigue. The cluster explained 29% (p less than 0.01) of the variance in QOL in the lung cancer survivors.\nThe data provided preliminary support for the presence of a symptom cluster in patients with lung cancer consisting of depression and fatigue. The cluster had a negative relationship with QOL. Survivors of lung cancer have depression and fatigue that affect QOL.\nHealthcare providers must assess the potential for symptoms to cluster, adversely affecting key patient outcomes such as QOL. Through increased knowledge of symptom clusters, clinicians will be able to more effectively target the most distressing set of symptoms for intervention.","title":"Symptom clusters and quality of life in survivors of lung cancer.","pubmedId":"16955121"}
