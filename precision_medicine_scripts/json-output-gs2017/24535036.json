Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway is abnormally activated in lung cancer cells. It is not clear whether the EGFR signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of miR-145 expression in lung cancer. In the present study, we found that the reduction of miR-145 was associated with EGFR abnormal activation in lung cancer cells. AG1478, an inhibitor of EGFR, may restore the expression of miR-145, indicating that EGFR activation is involved in the downregulation of miR-145 in lung cancer cells. Then, the application of STAT3, AKT and ERK1/2 inhibitors and siRNA against these signaling molecules indicated that ERK1/2 or AKT instead of STAT3 was involved in the process of miR-145 downregulation by EGFR. It was confirmed that AKT through activation of the ERK1/2 signaling molecules mediated the effect of EGFR on miR-145. Furthermore, we found that EGFR downregulated miR-145 through ERK1/2 in lung cancer cells. These findings establish EGFR and miR-145 links in lung cancer cells and therefore contribute to a better understanding of the role of EGFR in lung cancer cells, and provide clues for in-depth study of miR-145 expression and a possible direction for the further increase of miR-145 in lung cancer cells.
