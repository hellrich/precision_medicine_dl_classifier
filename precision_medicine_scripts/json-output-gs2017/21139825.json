Optimal treatment is radical orchidectomy. Radiotherapy or chemotherapy is added for advanced disease or recurrences. These practice guidelines often vary from the experience in developing countries.We present a 23-year old man who presented with paratesticular myxoid liposarcoma, after transscrotal orchidectomy for \u0027testicular tumor\u0027 without histology. He was subsequently managed by neoadjuvant chemotherapy and complete tumor excision.A case of paratesticular myxoid liposarcoma in a young man is highlighted. Also noted is the fact that complete extirpation at primary surgery reduces the risk of local recurrence. The practice of transscrotal orchidectomy and non-submission of surgical specimens is highlighted and condemned.","title":"Paratesticular myxoid liposarcoma in a 23-year old Nigerian.","pubmedId":"21139825"}
