The objective of this study was to investigate the association between VEGF gene polymorphisms and gastric cancer risk in Chinese Han patients. We extracted the peripheral blood samples in 150 patients with gastric cancer and 150 controls. Polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis was performed to detect three VEGF gene polymorphisms (-634 G/C, +936 C/T, and +1612 G/A) in these patients. Patients with gastric cancer had a significantly higher frequency of 1612 AA genotype (OR\u003d6.26, 95% CI\u003d1.80, 21.85; P\u003d0.004) than controls. Patients with cardia gastric cancer had a significantly lower frequency of AA (OR\u003d0.11, 95% CI\u003d0.01, 0.89; P\u003d0.04) than those with noncardia gastric cancer. Patients with Lauren\u0027s diffuse-type gastric cancer had a significantly higher frequency of AA (OR\u003d3.41, 95% CI\u003d1.22, 9.55; P\u003d0.02) than those with Lauren\u0027s intestinal-type gastric cancer. The -634 G/C and +936 C/T gene polymorphisms were not associated with a risk of GC and its progression. This study suggests that the VEGF +1612 G/A gene polymorphisms may be associated with gastric cancer in Chinese Han patients, and that difference in genotype distribution may be associated with the location and Lauren\u0027s classification of gastric cancer.","title":"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene polymorphisms and gastric cancer risk in a Chinese Han population.","pubmedId":"21344505"}
