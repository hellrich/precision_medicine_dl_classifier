However, the role of this PDPK in a lethal carcinoma, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, remains to be established.\nThe stable antisense clones with specific suppression of overexpressed PDPK F(A) of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells (MIA PaCa-2) were first selected and subsequently characterized for the in vitro and in vivo growth studies.\nThe molecular and cellular studies revealed that the antisense clones of MIA PaCa-2 cells with specific suppression of overexpressed PDPK F(A) potentially exhibited cell growth retardation, decreased serum independence, poor clonogenic growth and loss of anchorage-independent growth. The in vivo study further confirmed that the SCID mice injected with the antisense clones with low-level PDPK F(A) did not develop any detectable tumors even after 7-week observation. In sharp contrast, the parental or control-transfected clones developed very large tumors (\u003e5 cm3) under identical conditions.\nThe molecular, cellular and animal results taken together demonstrate that overexpressed PDPK F(A) is essential for the malignant growth of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","title":"Suppression of proline-directed protein kinase F(A) inhibits the malignant growth of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"15274314"}
