Northern blot analysis revealed overexpression of cyclin D1 in 12 of 65 (18%) ovarian carcinomas while CDK4 was overexpressed in 7 of 48 cases (14%). None of the tumors showed amplification of any of the 2 genes. Overexpression of cyclin D1 and CDK4 transcripts was correlated, suggesting a role of both genes in altered growth control of ovarian cancer cells. Elevated levels of cyclin D1 were significantly associated with a well-moderately differentiated grade (G1-G2) (p \u003c 0.005). No significant association was found between cyclin D1 expression and estrogen receptor, progesterone and epidermal growth factor receptor content. Cyclin D1 expression does not appear to be associated with clinical outcome in human ovarian cancer, although a longer follow-up period and screening of other molecules involved in the same pathway would be necessary to assess this hypothesis.","title":"Altered expression of cyclin D1 and CDK4 genes in ovarian carcinomas.","pubmedId":"9291427"}
