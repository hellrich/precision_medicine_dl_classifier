Xenograft models have shown that pharmacogenomic (PGx) modeling of C can predict efficacy. Chemo-sensitivity and gene expression profiling of tumor progenitor (TP) cells isolated from peripheral blood may predict tumor response, progression and resistance.  Methods:  A prospective MSKCC study is ongoing with 46 of 60 planned patients accrued. 10 mL of peripheral blood is collected from patients with unresectable PDAC prior to C and at disease progression. Clinical data is prospectively collected. Circulating TP cells are isolated (Vita-Cap, Vitatex Inc.), total RNA is extracted and gene-expression analysis is performed. PGx models for twelve chemotherapy drug combinations used in PDAC were created from the GI50 data obtained from the NCI-60 cell lines (CellPath Therapeutics, Inc., Baltimore, MD). Expression data were normalized through GCRMA then probed to identify expression differences between the 35 patients with continued disease response and the 11 patients with disease progression. Analysis was performed at the pathway and individual gene level.  Results:  TP cells were isolated and gene expression and chemo-sensitivity patterns were obtained in all 46 evaluable patients prior to initiating C and in all 11 patients at 1st line disease progression. Preliminary analysis demonstrates clinical benefit for patients treated with C predicted to be effective versus C predicted to be ineffective (TTP 4.4 mo versus 2.7 mo, p\u003d0.016). Changes in chemo-sensitivity patterns were evident at disease progression, reflecting treatment resistance. Hedgehog pathway over-expression was associated with resistance to gemcitabine but clinical response to 5-FU based treatment. Pathway analysis revealed that ErbB3, ARE/Nrf2 and Insulin pathways distinguished patients with disease progression.  Conclusions:  Isolation and gene expression profiling of TP cells can be performed reliably in unresectable PDAC. Preliminary analysis suggests that C profiling can predict response. Repeat PGx profiling identifies key pathways associated with treatment resistance.
