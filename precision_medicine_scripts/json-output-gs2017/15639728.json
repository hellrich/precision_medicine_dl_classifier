Available data indicate an increased cancer risk among PJS patients, which suggests that the gene involved in PJS, STK11 on chromosome 19p13.3, may be a tumour suppressor gene. Herein, bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) of mucinous type is reported in a 22-year old male PJS patient with a novel germline frameshift insertion in exon 2 at codon 118 of the STK11 gene. Molecular studies of his BAC indicated loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the region of STK11 on chromosome 19p13.3. This observation supports the hypothesis that STK11 is a tumour suppressor gene which is involved in the development of lung adenocarcinoma.","title":"Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma: a new cancer in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.","pubmedId":"15639728"}
