In the last decade, CT screening for lung cancer has attracted much attention for its ability to detect early peripheral lung cancer. Extremely recently, treatment using PDT has been introduced for the first time in patients with peripheral lung cancer, who did not meet the previous criteria for surgery. The procedure was carried out with local anesthesia with xylocain infiltrated into the chest wall, 48 h after Photofrin administration. Needles (19 gauge) containing an internal catheter were inserted percutaneously under CT guidance. The needles were then extracted and a diffuser fiber with a 2 cm long tip for light delivery was positioned in the tumor through the catheter. Of the nine patients enrolled in this trial, seven achieved partial remission (PR). No serious complications, except for two cases of pneumothorax, were noted. As an increasing number of patients consider quality of life after therapy, the indications for PDT are expected to expand. We conclude that PDT is a promising new technique for curative treatment of localized, peripheral lung cancer less than 1cm in size in patients who are unfit for surgery or radiotherapy.","title":"Photodynamic therapy for peripheral lung cancer.","pubmedId":"14698541"}
