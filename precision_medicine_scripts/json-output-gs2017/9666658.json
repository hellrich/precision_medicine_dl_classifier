She was referred to our Institution for operation of the pulmonary lesion by her family physician. The pathology was reported to be adenocarcinoma by the preoperative bronchofiberscopy. As she was Jehovah\u0027s witness, she refused to receive either homologous or autologous blood transfusion on the ground of her faith. Prior to the operation, the consultation was held together with the patient, family and doctors in reference to the informed consent. In June, 1997, she had left lower lobectomy without blood transfusion. Postoperative course was uneventful. The problems of surgical treatment in Jehovah\u0027s witness rejected blood transfusion are discussed.","title":"[Informed consent and surgical treatment in a 38-year-old female, Jehovah\u0027s witness with lung cancer].","pubmedId":"9666658"}
