The creation of mouse models that closely resemble the human disease has provided a platform to better understand when and in which cell types these pathways are misregulated during PDAC development. Here we examine the central part that KRAS plays in the biology of PDAC, and how the timing and location of Hh and Wnt-β-catenin signalling dictate the specification and oncogenic properties of PDAC.","title":"KRAS, Hedgehog, Wnt and the twisted developmental biology of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"20814421"}
