To find precursors for clinical GISTs of the stomach, small gastric stromal tumors of less than 3 cm were collected and examined immunohistochemically with analysis of the KIT mutation. Sixty-eight of 74 lesions were classified into 4 representative groups according to the expression of c-kit and α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA): group A, c-kit diffusely positive and αSMA negative (18 cases); group B, c-kit diffusely positive and αSMA focally positive (13); group C, c-kit focally positive and αSMA diffusely positive (27); and group D, c-kit negative and αSMA diffusely positive (10). Of the 4 groups, groups A and B of c-kit diffuse expression showed higher cellularity and labeling indices of p27(Kip1) and Ki-67 than did groups C and D of diffuse αSMA expression. Incidence of KIT exon 11 mutation in groups A and B was 86% (25/29), whereas that in groups C and D was 0% (0/20). Small gastric stromal tumors with c-kit diffuse expression were considered precursors for clinical GIST because they were significantly different from c-kit focally positive or negative tumors. The mutation of KIT is considered as an early event in tumorigenesis of GIST.
