We report a case of a 68 year old man with splenic metastasis from the primary lung cancer. Staging procedures before the resection of the primary lung tumor detected the splenic lesion. Upper left lobectomy and splenectomy were done by the left postero-lateral thoracotomy with phrenotomy. The rarity of solitary spleen metastasis from lung cancer and the treatment are discussed.","title":"[Solitary splenic metastases from lung cancer--one-time surgical procedure].","pubmedId":"15305659"}
