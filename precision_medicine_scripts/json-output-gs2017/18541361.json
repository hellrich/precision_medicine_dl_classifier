PMA has been shown to promote antiproliferative and antimigratory effects in many types of cancer cells. Our findings show that PMA induced a strong antiproliferative effect in two anaplastic (FRO and ARO) and one follicular (ML-1) thyroid cancer cell lines, and increased the fraction of FRO cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle. The fractions in the S and G2 phases were decreased. Moreover, PMA evoked a significant increase in the levels of the cell cycle regulators p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1. The levels of cyclin D3 and the cyclin-dependent kinases cdk4 and cdk6 decreased, as did the phosphorylation of the Rb-protein. PMA did not induce apoptosis. PMA stimulated the translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) alpha, betaI and delta isoforms to the cell membrane. PKCdelta small interfering RNA attenuated the PMA-induced antiproliferative effect and prevented the upregulation of p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1. Prolonged stimulation with PMA decreased the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. PMA also decreased the phosphorylation of Akt and evoked a biphasic change in the phosphorylation of the forkhead box class-O protein (FOXO): an increase in phosphorylation, followed by a dephosphorylation. In addition, PMA inhibited FRO, ARO and ML-1 cell migration toward serum. The inactive phorbol ester analog 4alpha-phorbol and the diacylglycerol analog 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol were without an effect on proliferation and migration. The results indicate that PMA is an effective inhibitor of thyroid cancer cell proliferation and migration by a mechanism involving PKC-MAP kinase/Akt and FOXO signaling.","title":"Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate inhibits FRO anaplastic human thyroid cancer cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest in G1/S phase: evidence for an effect mediated by PKCdelta.","pubmedId":"18541361"}
