Several biomarkers and signaling pathways have been recognized as conceivable targets for treatment, and among them is the mesenchymal-epithelial transition/hepatocyte growth factor (c-MET/HGF) axis. Alterations in the c-MET gene and aberrations of MET and HGF expression impact on lung cancer prognosis and are involved in resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring activating EGFR mutations. Several anti-MET and anti-HGF strategies are currently under investigation, including monoclonal antibodies. Ficlatuzumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against HGF that is currently under investigation in NSCLC. The aim of the present review is to critically review available data on HGF and ficlatuzumab in NSCLC.","title":"Focus on the potential role of ficlatuzumab in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"23493885"}
