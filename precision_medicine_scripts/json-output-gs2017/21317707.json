The specimens were from the retroperitoneum (3), pelvis (1) or paratesticular region (1), and all 5 specimens comprised exclusively or predominantly dedifferentiated liposarcoma. All 5 dedifferentiated liposarcomas showed prominent metaplastic bone, 3 produced cartilage, and 1 also had osteosarcomatous tissue. The whorls comprised concentric distributions of spindle or epithelioid cells. All cases expressed smooth muscle actin, 3 strongly, whereas 4 cases showed at least focal claudin-1 positivity. In all cases, the whorls expressed at least 2 of CDK4, MDM2, and p16. The presence of 2 morphologic subsets and the immunohistochemical findings suggest that the whorls in these dedifferentiated liposarcomas exhibit divergent myofibroblastic and possibly perineurial differentiation. The CDK4, MDM2, and p16 expression in the whorls suggests that they share a similar genetic background to well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma, and that additional genetic events are causal to their distinct morphology.","title":"Dedifferentiated liposarcoma with meningothelial-like whorls, metaplastic bone formation, and CDK4, MDM2, and p16 expression: a morphologic and immunohistochemical study.","pubmedId":"21317707"}
