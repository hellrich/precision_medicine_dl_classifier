It is unknown if this association is causal.\nThis is a single-site study of patients who underwent surgical pancreatic tumor resection and self-identified as Ashkenazi Jewish. DNA from normal pancreatic tissue was genotyped for the three Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1/2 founder mutations BRCA1 185delAG, BRCA1 5382insC, and BRCA2 6174delT, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was determined by sequencing DNA from microdissected tumor. When additional tumor tissue was available, p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC) was conducted.\nThirty-seven patients underwent surgery for PDAC, seven for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), and 19 for other diseases. A high prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations was found in the surgical cohort (12/63; 19.0%; P \u003c 0.001), PDAC cohort (8/37; 21.6%; P \u003c 0.001), and IPMN cohort (2/7; 28.6%; P \u003d .01) compared with published control mutation frequency. A high prevalence of BRCA1 185delAG (8.1%; P \u003c 0.001) and BRCA2 6174delT (10.8%; P \u003c 0.001) in Ashkenazi Jewish patients with PDAC was shown. BRCA1/2 LOH was found in 2 of 4 BRCA1-associated PDACs and 3 of 4 BRCA2-associated PDACs. Positive p53 IHC was found in 5 of 8 BRCA1/2 PDACs.\nWe show a high prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations with LOH in an Ashkenazi Jewish cohort of surgically resected PDAC and neoplastic lesions, suggesting that these germline mutations are causal in selected individuals.","title":"High prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations with loss of heterozygosity in a series of resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma and other neoplastic lesions.","pubmedId":"23658460"}
