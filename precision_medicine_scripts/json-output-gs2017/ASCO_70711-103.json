Methods: Primary tumors from 112 mCRC patients were analyzed. The worst skin toxicity during treatment was recorded. Results: KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations were present in 37 (33%), 8 (7.2%) and 11 (9.8%) cases, respectively, PTEN was lost in 21 (19.8%) cases, AREG and EREG were overexpressed in 48 (45%) and 51 (49%) cases. In the whole study population, time to tumor progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) was significantly lower in patients with KRAS (p\u003d0.001 and p\u003d0.026, respectively) or BRAF (p\u003d0.001 and p\u003c0.0001, respectively) mutant tumors, downregulation of AREG (p\u003d0.018 and p\u003d0.013, respectively) or EREG (p\u003d0.002 and p\u003d0.004, respectively) and in those with grade 0-1 skin rash (p\u003c0.0001 and p\u003c0.0001, respectively). In KRAS wt patients TTP and OS was significantly lower in patients with BRAF (p\u003d0.0001 and p\u003c0.0001, respectively) mutant tumors, downregulation of AREG (p\u003d0.021 and p\u003d0.004, respectively) or EREG (p\u003d0.0001 and p\u003c0.0001, respectively) and grade 0-1 skin rash (p\u003c0.0001 and p\u003c0.0001, respectively). TTP was significantly lower in patients with PIK3CA mutations (p\u003d0.01) or lost PTEN (p\u003d0.002). Multivariate analysis revealed KRAS (hazard ratio [HR] 4.3, p\u003c0.0001), BRAF mutation (HR: 5.1, p\u003c0.0001), EREG low mRNA expression (HR: 1.6, p\u003d0.021) and absence of severe/moderate skin rash (HR: 4.0, p\u003c0.0001) as independent prognostic factors for decreased TTP. Similarly, KRAS (HR 2.9, p\u003d0.01), BRAF mutation (HR: 3.0, p\u003d0.001), EREG low mRNA expression (HR: 1.7, p\u003d0.021), absecence of severe/moderate skin rash (HR: 3.7, p\u003c0.0001) and the presence of undifferantited tumours (HR: 2.2, p\u003d0.001) were revealed as independent prognostic factors for decreased OS. Conclusions: These results underscore the potential of advanced CRCs genetic profiling in order to identify patients with different treatment response.","title":"Impact of KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations, PTEN, AREG, and EREG expression, and skin rash in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with cetuximab-containing salvage treatment.","pubmedId":"ASCO_70711-103"}
