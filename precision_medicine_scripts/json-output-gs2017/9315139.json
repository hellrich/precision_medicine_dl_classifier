The nerve of origin of a schwannoma is often demonstrated on the periphery along the capsule but not penetrating the substance of the tumor. However, there is a possibility that NF2 schwannomas and solitary schwannomas differ from participation in nerve components.\nIn this study, the authors noted the relationship between the tumor and the original nerves. To detect whether there were embedded nerves in the tumor, immunohistologic staining using neurofilament and myelin basic protein antibodies was performed on 6 NF2 schwannomas and 17 non-NF2 schwannomas.\nFour of five NF2 schwannomas had embedded nerves and one of four, which was considered to be the early stage of the tumor occurrence, remarkably embedded original nerves. On the other hand, embedded nerves were not seen in non-NF2 schwannomas.\nThe authors concluded that the NF2 schwannomas tend have original nerves embedded in the tumor substance, which may be based on the difference of the motility of tumor cells, and the authors believe that it is difficult to remove NF2 schwannomas while preserving the original nerve.","title":"A comparative study of embedded nerve tissue in six NF2-associated schwannomas and 17 nonassociated NF2 schwannomas.","pubmedId":"9315139"}
