Un-fortunately, little is known about the characteristics of IGC in Korea, a country with a high incidence of gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinicopathologic char-acteristics of IGCs in Korea.\nFrom January 2006 to July 2011, a total of 81,762 subjects underwent screening EGD at Yonsei University Health Promotion Center, Seoul, Ko-rea. We defined missed cancer as cancer diagnosed within 1 year of screening EGD and latent cancer as cancer diag-nosed more than 1 year after EGD.\nA total of 16 IGC patients (17 lesions; three missed cancers and 14 latent can-cers) were identified, with a mean age of 60.68 years and a mean interval time of 19.64 months. IGCs tended to be undifferentiated (12/17, 70.6%), located in the lower body of the stomach (12/17, 70.6%) and exhibited flat/depressed endoscopic morphology (11/17, 64.7%). The patients with missed cancer were generally younger than the patients with latent cancer (51.3 years vs 62.8 years, p\u003d0.037), and the patients with undifferentiated cancer were significantly younger than those with differentiated cancer (57.0 years vs 68.8 years, p\u003d0.008).\nIGCs tended to be undif-ferentiated, located in the lower body of the stomach, and exhibited flat/depressed endoscopic morphology.
