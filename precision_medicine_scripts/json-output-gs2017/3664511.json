Amplification of c-erbB-2 was found in 15 of 86 primary breast cancers and in 3 of 12 secondary breast cancers. Amplification was more common in breast tumors of advanced stage, and in tumors which had metastasized to regional lymph nodes sites. Gene amplification was observed in 21% (4 of 19) of primary tumors which recurred within 3 years of mastectomy and in 6% (2 of 32) of nonrecurrent tumors.","title":"Association of multiple copies of the c-erbB-2 oncogene with spread of breast cancer.","pubmedId":"3664511"}
