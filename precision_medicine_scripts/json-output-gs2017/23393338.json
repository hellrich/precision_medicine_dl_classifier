The gene amplification of S6K1 and S6K2 were determined using a DNA copy number assay of 213 gastric cancer tissues.\nS6K1 and S6K2 amplifications were observed in one and three cancer cell lines, respectively. No amplification of S6K1 was detected in the gastric cancer tissues, while S6K2 amplification was observed in 4.7% of the gastric carcinoma tissues. Patients with stage IV gastric cancer whose tumors exhibited amplification had a significantly shorter overall survival.\nS6K2 amplification was frequently observed in gastric cancer and was related to a poor prognosis. Our findings may provide novel insight into the dysregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling by S6K2 amplification in gastric cancer.","title":"Gene amplification of ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 and -2 in gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"23393338"}
