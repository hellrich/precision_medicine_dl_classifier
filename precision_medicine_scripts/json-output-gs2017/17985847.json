In this study, the six polymorphisms associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), N-acetyltransferase2 (NAT2) gene polymorphisms T341C, G590A, and G857A, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphisms C677T and A1298C, and serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) gene promoter polymorphism C-13T were simultaneously detected by the electrochemical DNA chip and the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method, which is a novel technique for DNA amplification. Human genomic DNAs were extracted from blood, and the targets containing the six polymorphisms were amplified by the LAMP method. A sample containing the six LAMP products was reacted with the electrochemical DNA chip using a DNA detection system that controls hybridization reaction, washing, electrochemical detection, and data analysis automatically. A total of 31 samples were genotyped by this method, and the results were completely consistent with those determined by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis or the PCR direct sequence analysis. The time required for this method was only 2 h, and operations were very simple. Therefore, this method is expected to contribute to personalized medicine based on genotype.","title":"Detection of six single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with rheumatoid arthritis by a loop-mediated isothermal amplification method and an electrochemical DNA chip.","pubmedId":"17985847"}
