Mechanisms of cisplatin resistance have been extensively investigated, and ERCC1 has emerged as a key player due to its central role in the repair of cisplatin-induced DNA lesions. However, clinical data have not unequivocally confirmed ERCC1 status as a predictor of the response to cisplatin treatment. Therefore, we employed an autochthonous mouse model of Kras-driven lung adenocarcinoma resembling human lung adenocarcinoma to investigate the role of Ercc1 in the response to cisplatin treatment. Our data show that Ercc1 deficiency in Tp53-deficient murine lung adenocarcinoma induces a more aggressive tumor phenotype that displays enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin treatment. Furthermore, tumors that relapsed after cisplatin treatment in our model develop a robust etoposide sensitivity that is independent of the Ercc1 status and depends solely on previous cisplatin exposure. Our results provide a solid rationale for further investigation of the possibility of preselection of lung adenocarcinoma patients according to the functional ERCC1- and mutational TP53 status, where functionally ERCC1-incompetent patients might benefit from sequential cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy.\nThis study provides a solid rationale for the stratification of lung adenocarcinoma patients according to the functional ERCC1- and mutational TP53 status, where functionally ERCC1-incompetent patients could benefit from sequential cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy.
