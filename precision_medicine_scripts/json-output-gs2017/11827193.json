Both patients had been monitored by surveillance endoscopy once a year since their proctocolectomy. The father was found to have an ampullary adenoma 26 years after proctocolectomy, and ampullary carcinoma was detected 2 years later, for which pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. Histological examination of the specimen revealed an ampullary carcinoma, 2.5 x 1.7 cm, that had invaded the submucosal layer, but no lymph node metastasis was found. The patient\u0027s daughter underwent endoscopy, which showed an ampullary polyp 6 years after total colectomy. Endoscopic mucosal resection of the periampullary lesion was performed, and histological examination revealed a dysplastic tubular adenoma 0.6 x 0.4 cm in diameter. This report reinforces the importance of long-term periodic surveillance of patients with FAP by gastroduodenal endoscopy.","title":"Successful resection of ampullary carcinoma in a father and adenoma in a daughter with familial adenomatous polyposis following detection by surveillance: report of two cases.","pubmedId":"11827193"}
