We report a case of a 56-year-old male treated for a right lower extremity liposarcoma at the age of 30 years, whose first recurrence was an intracerebral metastasis occurring 26 years after resection of the primary tumor. Initial treatment of the metastasis with surgical resection and adjuvant radiotherapy was followed rapidly by CNS recurrence in 3 months. Further debulking and interstitial brachytherapy were unsuccessful in controlling disease progression. Clinical presentation and treatment of brain metastases in soft-tissue sarcoma are discussed.","title":"Late onset of isolated central nervous system metastasis of liposarcoma--a case report.","pubmedId":"8677903"}
