Therapeutic options for this subgroup of tumours are limited, essentially doxorubicin-based regimens and trabectedin. Recently, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been identified as a therapeutic target in several sarcomas. MRCLs should be included among these, as various molecular aberrations of the mTOR pathway have been recently reported.\nPI3KCA mutations were identified in 10-20% of MRCLs. Other molecular aberrations include loss of PTEN, Akt activation and overexpression of IGF1R. Recently, two minor responses to mTOR inhibitors were reported.\nThe relatively high frequency of mTOR signalling pathway alterations in MRCL provides a preclinical rationale for considering mTOR inhibition as a potential novel therapeutic strategy warranting further investigation.","title":"Myxoid liposarcoma and the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway.","pubmedId":"23673410"}
