We have recently reported that EV20, a humanized anti-ErbB3 antibody, possesses a marked antitumor activity in a variety of human tumor models, including pancreatic cancer (PC). Here, we report that despite epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression, PC cells are more sensitive to NRG-1β than EGF in terms of Akt activation and cell proliferation. Using stable ErbB-3-knocked down cells and EV20 in combination with trastuzumab, we showed that dual targeting of ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 was necessary to completely abrogate ErbB-3 signaling and to impair cell proliferation. Similarly, enhanced therapeutic efficacy of the antibody combination was seen in xenografts originating from K-Ras-mutated HPAF-II and SW1990 cells, without increasing the toxicity. These results indicate that dual targeting of ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 could represent a new therapeutic approach in PC.Oncogenesis (2014) 3, e117; doi:10.1038/oncsis.2014.31; published online 18 August 2014.
