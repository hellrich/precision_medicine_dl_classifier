Three more cases are added to the few previously reported in the literature. An awareness of this association together with modern techniques of investigation, particularly CAT scanning, may permit earlier diagnosis and treatment of more cases. Meningioma as well as carcinoma of the breast is more common in women and the incidence of both tumors reaches a peak in the fifth and sixth decades. Both are related to pregnancy and have an estrogen-receptor protein. Lesions of the central nervous system following the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer are usually presumed to be metastatic. Therefore, these lesions may be irradiated without complete clinical investigation. If the clinician is aware of this association, appropriate diagnostic procedures could lead to the surgical removal of a benign meningioma. Skull x-rays, bone scan, brain scan, CAT scan, and cerebral angiograms are useful in making a diagnosis. Besides surgery, radiation therapy and hormonal therapy may play a role in the management.","title":"Carcinoma of the breast and meningioma. Association and management.","pubmedId":"6831359"}
