Despite recent advances in early diagnosis and the development of molecularly targeted therapy, the overall survival of patients with metastatic colon cancers remains disappointing (1). This is often associated with resistance of colon cancer cells to systemic therapies resulting from oncogenic mutations of KRAS that drive activation of multiple downstream signalling pathways important for cell survival and proliferation. Here we report that mutant KRAS colon cancer cells are nevertheless more susceptible to apoptosis induced by the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor AUY922 than those carrying wild-type KRAS. Although AUY922 inhibited HSP90 activity with the comparable potency in colon cancer cells irrespective of their KRAS mutational statuses, those with activating mutations of KRAS were markedly more sensitive to AUY922-induced apoptosis. This was associated with upregulation of the BH3 only proteins Bim, Bik, and PUMA. However, only Bim appeared essential, in that knockdown of Bim abolished, whereas knockdown of Bik or PUMA only moderately attenuated apoptosis induced by AUY922. Mechanistic investigations revealed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was responsible for AUY922-induced upregulation of Bim, which was inhibited by a chemical chaperone or overexpression of GRP78. Conversely, siRNA knockdown of GRP78 or XBP-1 enhanced AUY922-induced apoptosis. In addition, AUY922 inhibited the growth of mutant KRAS colon cancer xenografts through activation of Bim that was similarly associated with ER stress. Taken together, these results suggest that AUY922 is a promising drug in the treatment of mutant KRAS colon cancers, and that agents that enhance the apoptosis-inducing potential of Bim may be useful to improve the therapeutic efficacy.","title":"Inhibition of hsp90 by auy922 preferentially kills mutant KRAS colon cancer cells by activating Bim through ER stress.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-3066"}
