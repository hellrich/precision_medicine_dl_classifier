We describe here standard mechanisms of transcription in eukaryotic cells, an influence of common promoter polymorphisms contributing to malignant progression and DNA methylation as significant aspect of gene regulation. We also described transcription factors mechanism of action, and how their alteration can result in cancer.","title":"Regulation of transcription in cancer.","pubmedId":"22201746"}
