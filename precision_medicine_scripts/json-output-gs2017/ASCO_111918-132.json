The LCMC was established in 2009 to assay lung adenocarcinomas for driver genomic alterations in 10 genes and to study and treat patients by their molecular subtypes.  Methods:  The 14-member LCMC enrolled patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung and tested their tumors in CLIA laboratories for KRAS, EGFR, HER2, BRAF, PIK3CA, AKT1, MEK1, and NRAS mutations using multiplexed assays, and for ALK rearrangements and MET amplifications using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).    Results:  1,102 eligible patients were enrolled; 1,007 underwent testing for at least one genomic alteration with 733 undergoing testing for all 10 genes.  600 patients were women (60%) with a median age of 63; 341 were never smokers (34%) and 589 former smokers (58%).  A driver alteration was detected in 622 (62%) of the 1,007 with any genotyping, and in 465 (63%) of the 733 fully genotyped cases.  Among the tumors with full genotyping, drivers were found as follows: KRAS 182 (25%), sensitizing EGFR 107 (15%), ALK rearrangements 56 (8%), other EGFR 43 (6%), two genes 29 (4%), BRAF 16 (2%), HER2 15 (2%), PIK3CA 6 (1%), MET amplification 5 (1%), NRAS 5 (1%), MEK1 1 (\u003c1%), and AKT1 0 (0%). Results were used to select targeted therapy or targeted trials in 279 patients with a driver alteration (28% of 1,007 total).  Among 938 patients with clinical follow-up and treatment information, 264 with a driver alteration treated with a targeted agent had a median survival of 3.5 years; 313 with a driver who did not receive targeted therapy had a median survival of 2.4 years; while 361 without an identified driver had a median survival of 2.1 years (p\u003c0.0001).   Conclusions:  An actionable driver alteration was detected in 62% of tumors from patients with lung adenocarcinomas, leading to use of a targeted therapy in 28%. The patients with an identified driver treated with a targeted agent lived longer than those patients who did not receive targeted therapy.  Multiplexed genomic testing can aid physicians in matching patients with targeted treatments and appropriate clinical trials.","title":"A multicenter effort to identify driver mutations and employ targeted therapy in patients with lung adenocarcinomas: The Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium (LCMC).","pubmedId":"ASCO_111918-132"}
