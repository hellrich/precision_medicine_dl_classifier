The authors reported two cases of the cystic meningioma. 1) The first case was 56-year-old female, whose complaints were motor weakness and hypesthesia on the right side. At the operation, a hen egg-sized tumor with a large cyst was removed totally from the left frontoparietal mid-convexity. Multiple cystic cavities were contained in the tumor. Histologically the tumor was compatible with meningocytic meningioma with angiomatous component and showed numerous myxomatous degeneration and swollen vessel-walls. 2) The second case was 17-year-girl complaining of headache, blurred vision, right hemiparesis and episodes of Jacksonian seizure. At the operation, a goose egg-sized tumor in the left parietal lobe was removed and the tumor contained a large cyst. Histologically the tumor was a malignant meningioma, associating with relatively fresh necroses adjacent the cyst. 3) The pathogenesis of the cystic changes in meningioma was discussed.","title":"[Cystic meningioma--report of two cases (author\u0027s transl)].","pubmedId":"986575"}
