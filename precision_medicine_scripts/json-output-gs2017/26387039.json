Patients with chemotherapy-naive locally advanced disease with active EGFR mutations will receive the induction treatment, specified as gefitinib monotherapy (250 mg/body) for 8 weeks. Patients whose disease has not progressed during the induction therapy will receive cisplatin and docetaxel (40 mg/m(2)) on days 1, 8, 29, and 36, and concurrent 3-dimensional conformal thoracic radiotherapy with a single daily fraction of 2 Gy, for 5 consecutive days each week to provide a total dose of 60 Gy. The primary end point is overall survival at 24 months. A target sample size of 21 evaluable patients is considered sufficient to validate an expected rate of 85%, and 60% would be the lower limit of interest, with 80% power and a 1-sided Î± of 5%. Secondary end points include toxicity, response rate, and overall survival. This study will clarify whether tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeted to EGFR can produce a maximal effect in selected NSCLC patients with the relevant driver mutation, even in the locally advanced setting.
