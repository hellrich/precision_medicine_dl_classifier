BCS from these populations may have very different experiences from other Canadian women which may render them vulnerable, with unique impacts, concerns and special needs after treatment. Methods: A qualitative approach was used to explore experiences and concerns of South Asian BCS at different life stages in order to determine their understanding of follow-up cancer care. Focus group and face-face interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed with SA women with non-metastatic breast cancer, 3-60 months post-treatment, discharged from oncologist care. Groups were stratified by age into \u003c44, 45-54, 55-64, and \u003e65. Transcripts were subjected to thematic analysis by age group (life stage). Results: 24 women participated in the study. The impacts of breast cancer were broad and varied by age group. Physical, emotional, and psychosocial effects are more intense in younger patients with older patients experiencing more consistent positive social and spiritual support. Fatigue and fear of the unknown were the most universal effects with cultural nuances experienced by women. Emphasis on generalized survivorship care plan (SCP) with individualized content echoes the wide variation in breast cancer impact. Important elements include: treatment summary, information on exercise, expected side effects, follow-up schedule, and knowledge of information sent to family physician. Preferred media is a written booklet format for SCP and is similar for all groups. Consultation at beginning of treatment with an oncology nurse is ideal. Conclusions: Survivors are diversely impacted by the breast cancer experience. Effects vary by life stage, which impacts preferred content of SCP, but not format. Qualitative information on the impact of breast cancer at different life stages can be used to help customize content of SCPs.","title":"Impacts of breast cancer treatment for South Asian women breast cancer survivors.","pubmedId":"ASCO_60180-100"}
