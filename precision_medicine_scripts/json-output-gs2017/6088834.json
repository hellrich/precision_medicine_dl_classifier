Furthermore, the correlation between its clinical application and chemotherapeutic effects was also looked up. The results obtained were as follows; Take-rate of human lung cancer in Nu-mouse was 53.7% in primary lung cancer and 92.8% in metastatic ones. Those xeno-grafts were able to use as target cell of this test. In these tests, there were some cases which effective drugs were selected, but a few cases which all drugs were non-response. Response rate of primary lung cancer to treat with effective drugs is 25%, but that of metastatic lung tumors with the same treatment is 57%. Therefore, if the aggressive chemotherapy will be trying for malignant lung tumor, this in vivo sensitivity test to select effective drugs shall be one of the useful test.","title":"[In vivo sensitivity test of anti-cancer drugs against malignant lung tumor xeno-graft].","pubmedId":"6088834"}
