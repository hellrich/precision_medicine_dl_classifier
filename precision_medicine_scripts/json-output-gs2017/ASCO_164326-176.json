GGNBP2 has a single C2H2 zinc finger and a consensus LxxLL nuclear receptor (NR) binding motif. It has been reported that GGNBP2 being remarkably down-regulated in several human cancer cell lines. The similar NR binding motifs are also found in some other known breast cancer susceptibility genes such asBRCA1, suggesting that GGNBP2 may function as a candidate of breast cancer susceptibility gene. Methods: A cancer expression array containing 50 pair-wise human normal and breast tumor tissues were utilized to examine GGNBP2 expression in breast cancer samples. To address the potential anti-breast tumor activity of GGNBP2 in vitro, we expressed exogenous GGNBP2 in T47D, MCF-7, MCF-10A and MCF-10F cells. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion were assessed by cell growth curve, wound healing assays and colony formation assays, respectively. In vitro protein-protein interaction and luciferase reporter assays were performed to determine whether GGNBP2 interacts with ER and modulates its transcriptional activity. qPCR and Western blot were carried out to evaluate the effects of GGNBP2 overexpression on ERa target genes, CCND1 and TFF1 expression. The anti-oncogenic activity of GGNBP2 was further verified by xenograft in mice. Results:GGNBP2 expression is reduced in primary human breast tumors. Overexpression of GGNBP2 selectively inhibits the proliferation of ER positive breast cancer cells. Stable GGNBP2 overexpression in T47D cells inhibits 17-estradiol (E2)stimulated proliferation as well as migration, invasion, anchorageindependent growth in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in mice. We further demonstrate that GGNBP2 protein physically interacts with ER, inhibits E2-induced activation of estrogen response element-driven reporter activity and attenuates ER target gene expression in T47D cells. Conclusions: GGNBP2 is a novel breast cancer tumor suppressor functioning as a nuclear receptor co-repressor to restrain ER activity and tumorigenesis in human breast cancer.","title":"GGNBP2 to suppress tumor growth through modulating ER action in breast cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_164326-176"}
