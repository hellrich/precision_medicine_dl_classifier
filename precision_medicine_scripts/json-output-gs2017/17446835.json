Evidences from in vivo and in vitro results have shown that PDT significantly decreases pancreatic cancer cell growth, destroys pancreatic carcinoma, and prolongs the survival of patients with unresectable pancreatic malignancy, and also show that PDT has disadvantages and limitations for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.\nPhotodynamic therapy can be an effective treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer, but more extensive preclinical and clinical trials are needed for further improvement in the clinical application of PDT, especially in avoidance of complications during PDT.","title":"Photodynamic therapy for pancreatic cancer.","pubmedId":"17446835"}
