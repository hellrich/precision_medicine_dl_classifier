Among them were 16 patients (4%) aged between 29 and 40 years (mean: 34 years) and smokers (mean cumulative tobacco consumption 24 P.A.). Six of these (37%) had lung parenchyma dystrophy with bilateral apical bullae of emphysema, 1 had a clean cavity left by a previous lung abscess and 1 had microcytic fibrosis resulting from histiocytosis X of the lungs and bones. In all cases cancer had developed in contact with bullous lesions or sequelae. Cancer was discovered during radiological mass screening in 6 cases (37.5%), on the finding of systemic or thoracic symptoms in 5 cases and because of a distant metastasis in 5 other cases. Pathological examination revealed an adenocarcinoma in 8 out of 16 patients and only one small-cell carcinoma. Nearly two-thirds of the patients had reached an advanced stage: 3 were in stage III A, 1 in stage III B and 6 in stage IV. Eight patients underwent curative surgery (7 lobectomies, 1 pneumonectomy). Survival was known with precision in 14 patients: 8 died after a mean follow-up of 15 months (range: 3 and 31 months); 3 were alive with an active cancer and 4 are still alive in complete remission after curative surgery. Six published studies totalling 387 cases are concordant in demonstrating that primary lung cancer is severe in adults below 40 years of age and that surgery is useful in such cases, even with N2 lymph node involvement.","title":"[Primary bronchial cancer in subjects aged 40 or younger].","pubmedId":"1661914"}
