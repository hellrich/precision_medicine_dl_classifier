Paediatric GIST have an annual incidence of 0.02 per million children, have a female predisposition, are usually located in the stomach (50-60%) and in up to 85% of cases CD117-cKit or PDGFRA mutation is absent, resulting in a decreased efficacy of the target therapy.\nWe report the case of an incidentally diagnosed gastric GIST in a 14-year-old boy with multiple malformations. Genetic tests and Kariotype resulted negative. Recently, an abdominal US visualized an hypoechoic heterogeneous abdominal mass. The common tumor markers resulted negative and the abdominal CT-scan confirmed the presence of a solid round lesion (42Ã—36mm) in contact with the stomach and the pancreas. Laparoscopy allowed the recognition and the removal of the nodular mass at the posterior margin of the stomach. The histopathologic and the molecular biology findings were consistent with a kit-wilde type GIST. Surgical margins were microscopically free of tumor cells. These results justify the decision not to add other surgical or medical therapy. However, for high risk of recurrence and metastasis, a close follow-up was started.\nGIST are asymptomatic in 10% to 30% of patients or present nonspecific symptoms and signs. These tumors present usually irregular, lobulated and ulcerated. CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are mandatory in the diagnostic work-up. The final diagnosis is based on histology and immunohistochemistry. Surgery is the first-line treatment in patients with localized disease.\nGuidelines for the management of pediatric GIST are not presently available for the paucity of reports and data. However it is widely accepted that surgery is the first-line treatment and gross resection with negative microscopic margins can be considered therapeutic and lead to full remission of the pathology. Laparoscopy is a safe surgical approach for the exploration of the abdominal cavity, the evaluation of the disease and the complete removal of the tumor.","title":"Laparoscopic resection of a rare gastrointestinal stromal tumor in children.","pubmedId":"25717425"}
