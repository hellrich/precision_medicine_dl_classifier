In addition, immunohistochemical staining for maspin, S100P, IMP-3, and pVHL was performed on cell blocks from 67 pancreatic fine-needle aspiration cases, including 44 cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\nThe results demonstrated that (1) more than 90% of cases of ductal adenocarcinoma were positive for maspin, S100P, and IMP-3; (2) nearly all adenocarcinoma cases were negative for pVHL, whereas nonneoplastic ducts and acini were positive for pVHL in all cases; (3) normal/reactive pancreatic ducts were frequently positive for CK7, CK19, MUC1, MUC6, CA19-9, MOC31, PSCA, mesothelin, annexin A8, claudin 4, and claudin 18; (4) normal pancreatic ducts were usually negative for IMP-3, maspin, S100P, CK17, MUC2, MUC4, and MUC5AC; (5) 60% of adenocarcinomas were negative for DPC4/SMAD4; and (6) strong background staining was frequently seen with fascin, PSCA, and annexin A8.\npVHL, maspin, S100P, and IMP-3 constitute the best diagnostic panel of immunomarkers for confirming the diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in both surgical and fine-needle aspiration specimens.","title":"Reevaluation and identification of the best immunohistochemical panel (pVHL, Maspin, S100P, IMP-3) for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.","pubmedId":"22646265"}
