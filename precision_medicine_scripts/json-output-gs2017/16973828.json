Activation of an oncogenic allele of Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue (KRAS) in the reproductive tract of mice resulted in the development of endometriosis. We hypothesized that variation in KRAS may influence risk of endometriosis in humans. Thirty tagSNPs spanning a region of 60.7 kb across the KRAS locus were genotyped using iPLEX chemistry on a MALDI-TOF MassARRAY platform in 959 endometriosis cases and 959 unrelated controls, and data were analysed for association with endometriosis. Genotypes were obtained for most individuals with a mean completion rate of 99.1%. We identified six haplotype blocks across the KRAS locus in our sample. There were no significant differences between cases and controls in the frequencies of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or haplotypes. We also developed a rapid method to screen for 11 common KRAS and BRAF mutations on the Sequenom MassARRAY system. The assay detected all mutations previously identified by direct sequencing in a panel of positive controls. No germline variants for KRAS or BRAF were detected. Our results demonstrate that any risk of endometriosis in women because of common variation in KRAS must be very small.","title":"KRAS variation and risk of endometriosis.","pubmedId":"16973828"}
