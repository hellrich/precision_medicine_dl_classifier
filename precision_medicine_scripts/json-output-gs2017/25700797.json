However, the incidence of these mutations and their ability to predict response to TKIs in high-grade pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas [i.e. small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC)] is unknown.\nThe presence of EGFR mutations, clinicopathologic and anti-cancer therapy response data were retrospectively compiled and analyzed from a cohort of 608 patients-lung tumors to identify EGFR mutated high-grade pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas. We identified 126 EGFR-mutated (21.8% of 578 successful genotyped cases) lung cancers and only 2 (1.6%) were high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas.\nCase one was of a 63 year-old white never smoker woman with extensive stage SCLC harboring EGFR-delL747_P753insS but without EGFR protein expression. After progression on carboplatin/etoposide, the patient was treated with erlotinib and developed progressive disease with a survival \u003c3 months from start of erlotinib. Case two was of a 73 year-old Asian 30 pack-year smoker man with metastatic LCNEC harboring EGFR-delL747_P753insQS and also lacking EGFR protein expression. The patient received first line therapy with erlotinib and had progressive disease with a survival of 4 months.\nThe lack of response to EGFR TKIs in EGFR mutated de novo SCLC and LCNEC reported here may indicate that tumor differentiation affects tumor dependency on EGFR as a driver oncogene.","title":"De novo pulmonary small cell carcinomas and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas harboring EGFR mutations: Lack of response to EGFR inhibitors.","pubmedId":"25700797"}
