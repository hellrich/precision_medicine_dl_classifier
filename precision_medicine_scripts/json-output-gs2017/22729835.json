The aim of this study was to characterize further the expression of RUNX3 in lung cancers. To achieve this, a lung cancer tissue microarray (TMA), frozen lung cancer tissues and lung cell lines were examined for RUNX3 expression by immunohistochemistry, while the TMA was also examined for EGFR and p53 expression. RUNX3 promoter methylation status, and EGFR and KRAS mutation status were also investigated. Inactivation of RUNX3 was observed in 70% of the adenocarcinoma samples, and this was associated with promoter hypermethylation but not biased to EGFR/KRAS mutations. Our results suggest a central role of RUNX3 downregulation in pulmonary adenocarcinoma, which may not be dependent of other established cancer-causing pathways and may have important diagnostic and screening implications.","title":"RUNX3 downregulation in human lung adenocarcinoma is independent of p53, EGFR or KRAS status.","pubmedId":"22729835"}
