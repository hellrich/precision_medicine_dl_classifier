Comparison of the global transcription levels in wild type cells with two β-catenin gene disrupted clones identified 85 transcripts that were the most differentially regulated. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis of these transcripts identified \"cell adhesion\" as the most significantly enriched GO term. Here we describe the data from the transcription profiling analysis published in the article \"Implications of Targeted Genomic Disruption of β-Catenin in BxPC-3 Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Cells\" [1]. Data have been deposited to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database repository with the dataset identifier GSE63072.
