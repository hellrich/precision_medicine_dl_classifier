We report that homozygous deletion of PTEN in mammary epithelial cells induces tubulin-based microtentacles (McTNs) that facilitate cell reattachment and homotypic aggregation. Treatment with contractility-modulating drugs showed that McTNs in PTEN(-/-) cells are suppressible by controlling the actin cytoskeleton. Because outward microtubule extension is counteracted by actin cortical contraction, increased activity of actin-severing proteins could release constraints on McTN formation in PTEN(-/-) cells. One such actin-severing protein, cofilin, is activated in detached PTEN(-/-) cells that could weaken the actin cortex to promote McTNs. Expression of wild-type cofilin, an activated mutant (S3A), and an inactive mutant (S3E) demonstrated that altering cofilin phosphorylation directly affects McTNs formation. Chemical inhibition of PI3K did not reduce McTNs or inactivate cofilin in PTEN(-/-) cells. Additionally, knock-in expression of the two most common PI3K-activating mutations observed in human cancer patients did not increase McTNs or activate cofilin. PTEN loss and PI3K activation also caused differential activation of the cofilin regulators, LIM-kinase1 (LIMK) and Slingshot-1L (SSH). Furthermore, McTNs were suppressed and cofilin was inactivated by restoration of PTEN in the PTEN(-/-) cells, indicating that both the elevation of McTNs and the activation of cofilin are specific results arising from PTEN loss. These data identify a novel mechanism by which PTEN loss could remodel the cortical actin network to facilitate McTNs that promote tumor cell reattachment and aggregation. Using isogenic MCF-10A PTEN(-/-) and PIK3CA mutants, we have further demonstrated that there are clear differences in activation of cofilin, LIMK and SSH between PTEN loss and PI3K activation, providing a new evidence that these mutations yield distinct cytoskeletal phenotypes, which could have an impact on tumor biology.","title":"Loss of PTEN induces microtentacles through PI3K-independent activation of cofilin.","pubmedId":"22689060"}
