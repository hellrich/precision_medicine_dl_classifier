Ultimately, the choice of treatment is determined by a variety of factors, including institutional preference, individual physician judgment, patient preference, and resource availability. In this editorial, we make the case for radiation therapy (EBRT or brachytherapy) as the management modality of choice for localized prostate cancer.","title":"Radical radiotherapy for prostate cancer is the \u0027only way to go\u0027.","pubmedId":"19839425"}
