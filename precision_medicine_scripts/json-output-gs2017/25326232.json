Patient demographic, histologic characteristics, molecular characteristics, and outcomes in phase I protocols were compared per MET amplification status.\nOf 1,115 patients, 29 (2.6%) had MET amplification. The highest prevalence was in adrenal (2 of 13; 15%) and renal (4 of 28; 14%) tumors, followed by gastroesophageal (6%), breast (5%), and ovarian cancers (4%). MET amplification was associated with adenocarcinomas (P \u003d 0.007), high-grade tumors (P \u003d 0.003), more sites of metastasis, higher BRAF mutation, and PTEN loss (all P \u003c 0.05). Median overall survival was 7.23 and 8.62 months for patients with and without a MET amplification, respectively (HR \u003d 1.12; 95% confidence intervals, 0.83-1.85; P \u003d 0.29). Among the 20 patients with MET amplification treated on a phase I protocol, 4 (20%) achieved a partial response with greatest response rate on agents targeting angiogenesis (3 of 6, 50%). No patient treated with a c-MET inhibitor (0 of 7) achieved an objective response.\nMET amplification was detected in 2.6% of patients with solid tumors and was associated with adenocarcinomas, high-grade histology, and higher metastatic burden. Concomitant alterations in additional pathways (BRAF mutation and PTEN loss) and variable responses on targeted therapies, including c-MET inhibitors, suggest that further studies are needed to target this population.","title":"Analysis of 1,115 patients tested for MET amplification and therapy response in the MD Anderson Phase I Clinic.","pubmedId":"25326232"}
