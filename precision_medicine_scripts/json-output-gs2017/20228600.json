A 39-year-old woman with multiple brain metastases and bulky mediastinal lymph node metastases was admitted. Biopsy from her supraclavicular lymph nodes was performed to differentiate the diagnosis between lymphoma and lung cancer. Pathologically, the lymph nodes had a feature of adenocarcinoma. On the other hand, the commercially available chromosomal fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed split signals of ALK, which was confirmed to be the EML4-ALK inversion. The commercial-based ALK FISH is useful for screening pulmonary ALKoma.","title":"Incidentally proven pulmonary \"ALKoma\".","pubmedId":"20228600"}
