This finding provides insight into the relationship between host genotype and selection for somatic mutation type. Additional larger studies are required in diverse populations to further examine the interaction between MC1R and BRAF in different melanoma subtypes.","title":"Germline MC1R variants and BRAF mutant melanoma.","pubmedId":"18787543"}
