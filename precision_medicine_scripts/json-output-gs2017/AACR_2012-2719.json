This, in part, can be explained by the tumor cells responding to two or more growth factors in a redundant fashion. We show that cancer cell lines frequently rely on Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and Heregulin (HRG) signaling to support their survival and proliferation. Using a Network Biology approach, we have designed, constructed and optimized a novel bispecific antibody, MM-141, for co-targeting of ErbB3 and IGF-1R. MM-141 blocks IGF-1, IGF-2, and HRG binding to IGF1R and ErbB3, and causes downregulation of these receptors. MM-141 inhibits phosphorylation of IGF1R and ErbB3 as well as downstream activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. In our in vitro and in vivo testing, MM-141 displays potency in the presence of single or multiple ligands, over a broad range of receptor profiles. Inhibition of growth by MM-141 has been observed in vitro as well as in vivo in multiple xenograft models including human pancreatic cancer (BxPC-3) and human prostate cancer (DU145). MM-141 does not bind the insulin receptor, thus reducing the risk of metabolic side effects. Our in vivo and in vitro studies reveal that MM-141 has favorable pharmaceutical properties and pharmacokinetic profiles. We are advancing MM-141 into preclinical development. Taken together, these results suggest that MM-141 has the potential to be an effective therapeutic for treatment of patients with solid tumors.","title":"MM-141, a novel bispecific antibody co-targeting IGF-1R and ErbB3, blocks ligand-induced signaling and demonstrates antitumor activity","pubmedId":"AACR_2012-2719"}
