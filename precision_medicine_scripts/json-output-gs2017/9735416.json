We studied 59 sets of invasive ductal carcinoma, compared to matched normal control DNA. Microsatellite markers intragenic to BRCA1 (D17S1323, D17S1322, D17S855), BRCA2 (D13S1699, D13S1701, D13S1695) and ATM (D11S2179) were simultaneously used. In addition, one marker telomeric to BRCA2 (D13S1694) and four markers flanking ATM were analysed (D11S1816, D11S1819, D11S1294, D11S1818). Thirty-one per cent of the informative cases showed loss of heterozygosity for the BRCA1 gene, 22.8% for BRCA2 gene and 40% for ATM. LOH of BRCA1 correlated with high grade tumors (p\u003d0.0005) and negative hormone receptors (p\u003d0.01). LOH of ATM correlated with higher grade (p\u003d0.03) and a younger age at diagnosis (p\u003d0.03) in our set of tumors. No correlations were detected between BRCA2 LOH and any of the analysed clinicopathological parameters. However, a correlation was detected between allelic loss of the D13S1694 marker, telomeric to BRCA2, and larger tumor sizes and negative estrogen receptors, favoring the hypothesis of the presence of another putative tumor suppressor gene, telomeric to BRCA2, in the 13q12-q14 region. Only 11 tumors had LOH at more than one of the three genes, most of them (6/11) associated LOH of BRCA1 and ATM. One tumor only combined loss of the three genes BRCA1, BRCA2 and ATM.","title":"Loss of heterozygosity of BRCA1, BRCA2 and ATM genes in sporadic invasive ductal breast carcinoma.","pubmedId":"9735416"}
