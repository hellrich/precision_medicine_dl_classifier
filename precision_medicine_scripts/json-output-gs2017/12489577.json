This article is a review of the MRI characteristics of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the features that determine its resectability, and the optimal MR sequences needed for its effective evaluation. The role of MRI imaging is contrasted with other imaging and invasive modalities for the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","title":"Magnetic resonance imaging of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"12489577"}
