In this article, computed tomography appearances of 20 patients with histologically proven bronchogenic carcinoma were reviewed retrospectively. On the basis of the previous literatures and our findings, the computed tomography appearances of bronchogenic carcinoma associated with bullous lung disease could be classified into 3 types; nodule or mass extruding from the bullous wall, nodule or mass confined within the bullous lumen, and soft-tissue density extending along the bullous wall. Attention should be paid in the interpretations for mass or nodule in the wall of the bulla because they frequently lack the characteristic appearances of bronchogenic carcinoma.","title":"Computed tomography appearances of bronchogenic carcinoma associated with bullous lung disease.","pubmedId":"16778620"}
