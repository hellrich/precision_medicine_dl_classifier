They are usually seen in association with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF-2) or following radiation therapy. The tumors are more frequently intraventricular, cystic, and infratentorial than are those in adult patients. Pathologically they are more histologically aggressive than in adults and tend to recur more frequently. Complete resection is the surgical goal. The treatment of subtotally resected meningiomas, particularly in NF-2, remains controversial.","title":"Meningioma in the pediatric population.","pubmedId":"8858528"}
