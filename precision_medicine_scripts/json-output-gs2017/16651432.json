Drugs targeting the PI3K pathway aim to inhibit proliferation, promote apoptosis, and enhance chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity of cancer cells. The phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) phosphatidylinositol 3\u0027-phosphatase is a key negative regulator of the PI3K pathway. Inactivation of the PTEN tumor suppressor results in constitutive activation of the PI3K pathway and is found in approximately 50% of advanced prostate cancers, which correlates with a high Gleason score and poor prognosis. Inhibition of the PI3K pathway leads to apoptosis of prostate cancer cells; however, the precise mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Here we report that apoptotic cell death of PTEN-deficient LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cells induced by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 can be abrogated by disrupting Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) interactions with recombinant Fas:Fc fusion protein or FasL neutralizing antibody (Nok-1), or by expressing dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain. Furthermore, we find that apoptosis induced by expression of wild-type PTEN, driven by a tetracycline-inducible expression system in LNCaP cells, can be inhibited by blocking Fas/FasL interaction using Fas:Fc or Nok-1. These data show that apoptosis induced by blockade of the PI3K pathway in prostate tumor cells is mediated by an autocrine Fas/FasL apoptotic mechanism and the Fas apoptotic pathway is both necessary and sufficient to mediate apoptosis by PI3K inhibition.","title":"Inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3\u0027-kinase pathway promotes autocrine Fas-induced death of phosphatase and tensin homologue-deficient prostate cancer cells.","pubmedId":"16651432"}
