It was proposed that the RAS oncogene significantly contributes to skin cancer development. Numerous BRAF mutations have been detected in melanoma biopsy specimens and cell lines. For the first time, in the present study, tumor biopsy specimens from 78 patients with BCC were screened for BRAF mutation within exons 11 and 15. Our results indicate that the BRAF gene does not appear to be frequently mutated in nonmelanoma skin tumors such as BCC. These data suggest that other gene alterations may cause tumor development.","title":"Absence of BRAF gene mutation in non-melanoma skin tumors.","pubmedId":"16687919"}
