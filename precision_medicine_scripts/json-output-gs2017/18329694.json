In this study, we examined the significance of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in cholangiocarcinoma with respect to clinicopathologic features. We subjected 66 surgically resected specimens of cholangiocarcinoma of the large bile ducts to clinicopathologic examination, including postoperative survival, papillary phenotype, and immunohistochemical expression of MMP-2,-7, -9, and membrane type 1 MMP (MT1-MP). Nonneoplastic biliary epithelium did not express these 4 MMPs, whereas cholangiocarcinoma frequently expressed MMP-2 (33.9%), -7 (75.8%), -9 (47.5%), and MT1-MMP (54.5%). In particular, conventional (nonpapillary) cholangiocarcinoma expressed MMP-7 and MT1-MMP more frequently than papillary cholangiocarcinoma. The expression of MMP-7 and MT1-MMP significantly correlated with the nonpapillary phenotype, poorly differentiated histologic grade, perineural invasion, and advanced TNM stage. In contrast, the expression of MMP-2 and -9 was not associated with any of the clinicopathologic features. Univariate analysis of disease-specific survival revealed that a papillary phenotype and expression of MMP-7 were prognostic factors of cholangiocarcinoma, in addition to TNM stage, poorly differentiated histologic grade, perineural invasion, and microscopic margin status. Multivariate analysis showed only TNM stage to be an independent prognostic factor. Expression of MMP-7 in cholangiocarcinoma is an unfavorable postoperative prognostic factor of cholangiocarcinoma arising from the large bile ducts. Underexpression of MMPs in papillary cholangiocarcinoma might be associated with a favorable prognosis.","title":"Expression of matrix metalloproteinase 7 is an unfavorable postoperative prognostic factor in cholangiocarcinoma of the perihilar, hilar, and extrahepatic bile ducts.","pubmedId":"18329694"}
