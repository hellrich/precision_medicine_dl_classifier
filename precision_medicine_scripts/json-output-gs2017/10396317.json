This drug is already on the market and has been done many clinical trials. In order to evaluate its efficacy in treating NSCLC, many studies of gemcitabine by combination chemotherapy using agents such as cisplatin, which is a key drug in treating NSCLC, and paclitaxel, docetaxel and vinorelbine, which are novel anti cancer agents, were conducted. Although the efficacy of this drug was confirmed in terms of the combination therapy from the results, the optimal dosage schedule of this drug was not established because each study showed a different result in terms of the dosage as well as the dosage interval, thus, it is necessary to discuss and establish the optimal dosage schedule. Also comparative studies between the single therapy of gemcitabine and the existing combination therapy were conducted and it was reported that the single therapy was as effective as the conventional combination therapy. Based upon the results, it is considered that gemcitabine is a potential option in the chemotherapy for NSCLC. Gemcitabine has been already approved as indications for NSCLC as well as pancreatic cancer abroad and now there have been discussions on its efficacy against other kinds of cancer such as breast cancer. Clinical trials in order to evaluate its efficacy for pancreatic cancer have been conducted here in Japan and it is also expected to expand develop the efficacy against other kinds of cancer.","title":"[Gemcitabine hydrochloride is a new anti-cancer agent which will be available in the patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Japan].","pubmedId":"10396317"}
