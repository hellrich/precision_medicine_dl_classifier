The short-term response to BAI and survival period were reported. The responsive rates of CR and PR are 65% (75% in small cell carcinoma and 65% in squamous cell carcinoma). The overall mean survival period is 11.5 months (8 months in small cell carcinoma and 12 months in squamous cell carcinoma). We would like to point out that the comprehensive treatment based on BAI should be emphasized in order to improve the survival period. BAI followed by radiation therapy have an effect on completing each other in the therapy of squamous cell carcinoma. But, BAI should take the second place in treatment of small cell carcinoma.","title":"[The role of selective bronchial arterial infusion in the comprehensive treatment of advanced bronchial carcinoma].","pubmedId":"2561087"}
