A computed tomography (CT) scan showed multiple hepatic lesions with a high suspicion of metastatic disease from an unknown primary tumor. The differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy and hepatic lesions includes malignant tumors and various infectious diseases. The diagnostic process, however, revealed lymph node tuberculosis with multiple hepatic granulomas despite a repeatedly negative interferon-Î³ release assay. A combined antituberculosis therapy led to complete clinical remission.","title":"[A 76-year-old female patient with deep venous thrombosis and cervical lymphadenopathy].","pubmedId":"22476211"}
