We describe three cases of pregnant women with Stage Ib1 to IIa cervical cancer who were treated with paclitaxel plus platinum neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical surgery. The first patient had a Stage Ib1 small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix, the second had a Stage IIa, 8 cm squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and the third had a Stage Ib2 squamous cell carcinoma and positive lymph nodes. The three patients and their newborns were followed up. All patients had a partial or complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Two of these patients developed recurrences and one died due to progressive disease at 49 months. All neonates were healthy and had no abnormalities. In conclusion, neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel and platinum followed by radical surgery may be an option for pregnant women with invasive cervical cancer.","title":"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel plus platinum followed by radical surgery in early cervical cancer during pregnancy: three case reports.","pubmedId":"20427545"}
