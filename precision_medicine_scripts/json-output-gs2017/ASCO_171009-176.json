Yearly, more than 520,000 women worldwide are affected, and over 250,000 die. We investigated if TRAIL combined with dinaciclib, a multiple cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, would yield synergy in killing of cervical cancer cells. Published data have shown that dinaciclib inhibits CDK1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 at doses achieved in clinical trials. Methods: We used a colorimetric assay (MTS assay) to assess the effect of 24 hrs. of exposure with CDKi and TRAIL on 6 HPV+ cervical cancer lines (HeLa, SiHa, CaSki, C4I, ME180, SW756) and two HPV- cervical cancer lines (C33a, DOTC2). We used the CompuSyn platform to define synergy as a mean combination index of  0.7. We obtained microscopy images using a CCD camera. Western blotting was done to assess CDK expression. Results: The combination of TRAIL and dinaciclib resulted in growth inhibition (as assessed by MTS assays) in 5 of 6 HPV+ cell lines: HeLa, Caski, SiHa, ME-180, and C4I. Of the five susceptible HPV+ lines, CompuSyn revealed synergistic inhibition by TRAIL + dinaciclib in 4 of 5 HPV+ lines (80%) with the exception of the C4I line. Both HPV- lines showed susceptibility, though no synergy was seen in C33a cells. Synergy analysis of the HPV- DOTC2 line was non-interpretable as the IC50 was not calculable. Morphologically, most cells showed signs of apoptotic cell death due to TRAIL + dinaciclib and consistent with synergistic killing in the four cell lines as above. In 2 HPV+ cell lines (CaSki and Hela) in addition to evidence of apoptosis, there was evidence of cell swelling with heterogeneous nuclei, which can be seen in necroptosis. This finding was not seen in other HPV+ cell lines. At baseline, expression via western blotting revealed robust expression of CDK1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 12 in HPV+ CaSki cells. There was no CDK6 expression but otherwise CDK expression was similar in C33a HPV- cells. Dinaciclib (100 nM, 24 hr) also caused marked reductions in CDK12 in all cell lines tested (CaSki, HeLa, C33a). Conclusions: Four of six HPV+ lines showed synergistic death with dinaciclib and TRAIL. Synergy was not seen in one HPV- line, which also did not express CDK6.","title":"Effect of the combination of tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor dinaciclib on HPV+ cervical cancer cells.","pubmedId":"ASCO_171009-176"}
