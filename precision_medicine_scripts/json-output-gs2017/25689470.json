We previously found that lymphoblasts from sporadic PD patients display increased activity of the cyclin D3/CDK6/pRb pathway and higher proliferation than control cells. These features were considered systemic manifestations of the disease, as aberrant activation of the cell cycle is involved in neuronal apoptosis. The main goal of this work was to elucidate whether the inhibition of cyclin D3/CDK6-associated kinase activity could be useful in PD treatment. For this purpose, we investigated the effects of two histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, suberoylanilide hydroxamic (SAHA) acid and sodium butyrate (NaB), and the m-TOR inhibitor rapamycin on cell viability and cyclin D3/CDK6 activity. Moreover, the potential neuroprotective action of these drugs was evaluated in 6-hydroxy-dopamine (6-OHDA) treated dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells and primary rat mesencephalic cultures. Here, we report that both compounds normalized the proliferative activity of PD lymphoblasts and reduced the 6-OHDA-induced cell death in neuronal cells by preventing the over-activation of the cyclin D3/CDK6/pRb cascade. Considering that these drugs are already used in clinic for treatment of other diseases with good tolerance, it is plausible that they may serve as novel therapeutic drugs for PD. We report here that peripheral cells from Parkinson\u0027s disease (PD) patients show an enhanced proliferative activity due to the activation of cyclin D3/CDK6-mediated phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb). Treatment of PD lymphoblasts with inhibitors of histone deacetylases like suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and sodium butyrate (NaB), or with rapamycin, inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) normalized the proliferation of PD lymphoblasts by preventing the over-activation of the cyclin D3/CDK6/pRb cascade. These drugs were shown to have neuroprotective effects in both human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and primary rat mid-brain dopaminergic neuronal cultures toxicity induced by 6-hidroxydopamine. Considering that these drugs are already used in clinic for treatment of other diseases with good tolerance, it seems reasonable to believe that the repositioning of these drugs toward PD holds promise as a novel therapeutic strategy.
