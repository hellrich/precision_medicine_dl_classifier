The lack of association with solitary adenomatous polyps, the higher survival rate of patients with left-sided colon cancer, and the absence of extracolonic tumors were peculiar characteristics of this family. These data, in agreement with other reports, appear to suggest that the inherited colon cancer syndromes are not a single entity, but a group of related entities linked by their familial occurrence.","title":"Report of a family with hereditary site-specific colon cancer.","pubmedId":"3697942"}
