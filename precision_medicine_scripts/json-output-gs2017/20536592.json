To date, five genes for KS have been identified: KAL1, located on the X chromosome, and FGFR1, PROKR2, PROK2 and FGF8, which are involved in autosomally transmitted forms of KS.\nThe study characterised the dental ageneses of individuals with KS associated with mutations in the FGFR1 gene.\nSix individuals displaying dental agenesis were included. Clinical and radiological dental evaluations as well as medical anamneses were carried out.\nMicrodontia, screwdriver-shaped mandibular incisors, thin molar roots, and patterns of dental agenesis in both dentitions were observed. One to nine teeth were missing, most frequently, in descending order, lateral mandibular incisors, second premolars of upper and lower jaws, and lateral maxillary incisors. The pattern of dental agenesis is associated with four new mutations in the FGFR1 gene.\nDental agenesis may be a clinical feature of Kallmann syndrome caused by a mutation in the FGFR1 gene. These findings highlight the role that odontologists can play in the early diagnosis and treatment of gonadotropic deficiency.","title":"Dental agenesis in Kallmann syndrome individuals with FGFR1 mutations.","pubmedId":"20536592"}
