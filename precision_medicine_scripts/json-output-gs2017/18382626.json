There have been six previously reported examples of leiomyosarcomas associated with high levels of serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) production, comprised of cases originating from the retroperitoneum, spermatic cord, small intestine, and uterus. This report describes the first example of a dedifferentiated liposarcoma that combined both of the aforementioned features: extensive heterologous (leiomyosarcomatous) differentiation and beta-hCG production (maximum serum levels 1046 mIU/ml, reference \u003c5 mIU/ml). The tumor, which originated in the retroperitoneum in the region of the right kidney, was rapidly progressive and ultimately fatal within three months of its diagnosis. In addition to characteristic morphologic features, lipogenic and smooth muscle differentiation were confirmed with immunohistochemical stains for MDM2 and smooth muscle actin, respectively. The tumor also displayed diffuse immunoreactivity for beta-hCG in both primary and metastatic sites. This case further expands the clinicopathologic spectrum of lipogenic tumors.","title":"Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma of the Retroperitoneum with Extensive Leiomyosarcomatous Differentiation and beta-Human Chorionic Gonadotropin Production.","pubmedId":"18382626"}
