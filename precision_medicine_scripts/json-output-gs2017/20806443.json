Inclusive criteria were patients with exon 9-mutant, exon 11-mutant or wide type (WT) GIST, receiving chemotherapy of imatinib for clinical trial, and efficacy evaluation was cumulative response (CR) including complete response and partial response. The odds ratios (OR) for CR in stem cell factor receptor (KIT) mutation patients vs WT genotype patients, KIT exon 11-mutant genotype patients vs KIT exon 9-mutant genotype patients and KIT exon 9-mutant genotype patients vs WT genotype patients were calculated with 95% confidence interval (CI) for each study as an estimation of the efficacy of imatinib.\nFive studies including 927 patients were involved in this meta-analysis. The overall OR (KIT group vs WT group) was 3.34 (95% CI: 2.30-4.86, P \u003c 0.00001, P(heterogeneity) \u003d 0.04). The overall OR in KIT exon 11 group vs KIT exon 9 group was 3.29 (95% CI: 2.17-5.00, P \u003c 0.00001, P(heterogeneity) \u003d 0.33). The overall OR in KIT exon 9 group vs WT group was 1.23 (95% CI: 0.73-2.10, P \u003d 0.44, P(heterogeneity) \u003d 0.42).\nMost patients with different genotypes of GIST and KIT exon 11-mutant will benefit from the individualized treatment of imatinib.","title":"Efficacy evaluation of imatinib treatment in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors: a meta-analysis.","pubmedId":"20806443"}
