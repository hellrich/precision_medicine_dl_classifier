Previous reports have shown that RC have more KRAS and BRAF mutations and poorer clinical outcomes than LC. We investigated whether primary tumor location affects cetuximab efficacy in patients with RAS wild-type (WT) metastatic colon cancer determined by extended RAS genotyping. Methods: Extended RAS analysis by SequenomMassARRAY technology platform (OncoMap) targeting KRAS (exon 2, 3, 4), NRAS (exon 2, 3, 4), PIK3CA and BRAF (exon 15) was performed in tumors from 307 patients treated with cetuximab as salvage treatment. Tumors with mutated RAS (n \u003d 127) and synchronous primary tumors (n \u003d 10) were excluded. The border of right-sided colon and left-sided colon was defined as splenic flexure. Results: A total of 170 patients were included (RC versus LC, 23 and 147). More mutant BRAF (39.1% vs. 5.4%), poorly differentiated (17.4% vs. 3.4%) and mutant PIK3CA (13% vs. 1.4%) tumor and peritoneal involvement (26.1% vs. 8.8%) were observed in RC. Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly shorter in RC (2.0 vs 4.9 months, P \u003d 0.004). Overall survival (OS) was 4.1 months in RC and 13.0 months in LC (P \u003d 0.002). In multivariate analysis, BRAF mutations, RC, poorly differentiated histology and peritoneal involvement were associated with shorter overall survival (adjusted hazard ratios, 2.96, 1.63, 2.97 and 2.12, respectively). Conclusions: In RAS WT colon cancer treated with cetuximab as salvage treatment, right-sided colon cancer had a poor survival. Further investigation is required to verify the difference in cetuximab efficacy according to primary site of metastatic colorectal cancer.","title":"Association of right-sided colon cancer with poor efficacy of cetuximab in patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_170068-176"}
