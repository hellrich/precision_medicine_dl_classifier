An oncogenic, single hotspot mutation in the AKT1 gene, G49A:E17K, in the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT1, was described in human cancers with highest relative incidence in breast cancer. The E17K mutation in AKT1 results in PI3K-independent membrane recruitment of AKT1.Recently we reported the development of a highly selective, potent allosteric AKT1/2 inhibitor BAY 1125976 with strong in vitro and in vivo activity in tumor models with activated AKT signaling and strong synergistic activity in combination.The efficacy of BAY 1125976 was evaluated in tumor models carrying activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway by either deletion of PTEN or activating mutation in PI3K.We investigated whether BAY 1125976 can also inhibit AKT signaling in cell lines carrying an activating mutation in AKT. To this extend, KU-19-19 (AKT1E17K; NRASQ61R) bladder cancer as well as LAPC4 (AKT1E17K) prostate cancer cell lines both bearing the AKT1E17K mutation were profiled. BAY 1125976 potently inhibited AKT activation as well as downstream signaling in KU-19-19 and LAPC4 cells.Furthermore, anti-tumor efficacy of BAY 1125976 was tested in the patient-derived anal cancer xenograft AXF 984 (AKT1E17K). BAY 1125976 shows dose-dependent potent pathway activity in AKT1mut patient derived tumor model with inhibition of pAKT473 as well as downstream targets p- PRAS40 and p-FOXO3a compared to selected PI3K, AKT and mTOR inhibitors.Continuous daily treatment of AXF 984 (AKT1E17K) mouse xenografts with 25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg QD p.o. BAY 1125976 resulted in very potent statistically significant anti-tumor efficacy. All animals of these treatment groups exhibited tumor shrinkage or disease control with response rates of 88% and 83%, respectively. Furthermore, for animals treated with 50 mg/kg BAY 1125976 the delay of reaching a relative tumor volume of 600% was statically significant compared to the vehicle-treated control group.In summary, BAY 1125976 showed superior anti-tumor activity in AKT1E17K mutated models compared to PI3K and mTOR inhibitors. These results indicate that the clinical development of BAY 1125976 in patients with activating mutation in AKT could result in an innovative and more effective alternative to current treatments.","title":"BAY 1125976, is a selective allosteric AKT1/2 inhibitor with high efficacy in AKT1-mutated cancers","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-3685"}
