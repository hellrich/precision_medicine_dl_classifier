One of the most important genetic alterations in pancreatic cancer is within the kRAS oncogene. Over 60% of all pancreatic cancers, and up to 95% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, harbor mutations in this oncogene. While approaches to therapeutically modulate kRAS activity have not yielded clinical agents, downregulation of expression shows promise in preclinical models. To date, no molecular target has allowed for small molecule mediated downregulation of kRAS expression; however, the promoter region holds promise for a new approach. The kRAS promoter has three distinct guanine-rich regions capable of forming higher order non-B-DNA structures, G-quadruplexes (G4s). In particular the middle (mid) of these three regions forms a stable, inducible, and transcriptionally silencing G4 structures, whereas the more distal (far) region forms no such structure, and the more proximal (near) region has little to no biological function. The structure of this mid-region G4 has been elucidated by electromobility shift assay, DMS footprinting, and circular dichroism (CD). Small molecules capable of stabilizing this structure have been screened from the NCI Diversity Set III by the FRET melt assay, confirmed by CD, and examined for their downregulation of kRAS promoter activity. From the 1600 compounds, the indoloquinolone NSC 317605 is the lead molecule identified. It is particularly interesting as it prefers the mid-, as opposed to the near-, G4 and significantly reduces kRAS promoter activity. This is in contrast to the ellipticine NSC 176327, which favors the near-, over the mid-, G4 and does not decrease kRAS promoter activity. The effect of each compound on cell viability on kRAS transcription is under examination in a panel of pancreatic cancer cells. These works support previous findings that the mid-, and not the near-G4, harbors the potential to transcriptionally downregulate kRAS, and identify a new scaffold for future development.Brooks Lab startup funds, DoD, Rhianna Morgan GSC Grant, University of Mississippi School of Pharmacy","title":"Small molecule targeting of the kRAS mid-G-quadruplex for potential pancreatic cancer therapeutics","pubmedId":"AACR_2016-1254"}
