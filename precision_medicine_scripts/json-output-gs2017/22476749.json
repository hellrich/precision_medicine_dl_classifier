Our prior study revealed recurrent gains of 7q in myxofibrosarcomas where MET and CDK6 genes displayed increased DNA copies. Previously, we demonstrated the implication of MET overexpression, prompting us to further elucidate the roles of CDK6 in myxofibrosarcomas.\nOn tissue microarrays, CDK6 immunoexpression was assessable in 77 primary tumors, 55 of which were successfully quantified for CDK6 and MET genes by real-time PCR using genomic DNA extracted from laser-microdissected tumor cells. Gene status and protein expression of CDK6 were correlated with each other, clinicopathological variables, metastasis-free survival (MFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS).\nProtein overexpression and gene amplification of CDK6, which were detected in 21 of 77 (27.2 %) and 13 of 55 cases (23.6 %), respectively, were highly related to each other (p \u003c .001) and associated with higher grades (overexpression, p \u003d .004; amplification, p \u003d .014). There was a strong correlation between CDK6 and MET gene copies (p \u003c .001, r \u003d 0.0714). Importantly, CDK6 protein overexpression (MFS, p \u003d .0002; DSS, p \u003d .0015) and gene amplification (MFS, p \u003d .0001; DSS, p \u003d .0083) were both univariately associated with worse outcomes. Together with nonextremity location and AJCC stage III disease, CDK6 overexpression independently portended inferior MFS (p \u003d .0015, risk ratio [RR] \u003d 7.411). This aberration, along with nonextremity location, was also an independent adverse prognosticator of DSS (p \u003d .0069, RR \u003d 6.006).\nIn approximately a quarter of primary myxofibrosarcomas, CDK6 overexpression is mostly driven by gene amplification on 7q, associated with adverse prognosticators, and independently predictive of worse outcomes, highlighting its possible causative role in tumor aggressiveness.","title":"Recurrent amplification at 7q21.2 Targets CDK6 gene in primary myxofibrosarcomas and identifies CDK6 overexpression as an independent adverse prognosticator.","pubmedId":"22476749"}
