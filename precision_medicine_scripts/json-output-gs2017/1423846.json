Aberrant crypt foci are hypothesized to represent the earliest identifiable microscopic lesions of colon cancer in rodent colons. Sprague-Dawley male rats were injected with azoxymethane (20 mg/kg s.c.) once. Twelve weeks later, aberrant crypt foci were identified topographically, microdissected and processed for histology. In situ hybridization with an antisense oligomer of c-ras demonstrated increased expression of ras-specific RNA in aberrant crypts compared to normal crypts. A low amount of non-specific hybridization was obtained with the corresponding sense oligomer. The percentage of cells with grains (labeling index) was calculated in early and advanced aberrant crypt foci. This index was also calculated in normal appearing crypts. The labeling indices for the early and advanced aberrant crypt foci were significantly greater than that of normal crypts (18.0 and 25.0 versus 11.9). In the same tissue specimens, immunohistochemical staining for ras p21 with the monoclonal antibody (Y13-259) revealed strong staining intensity in early aberrant crypts (15/22) and advanced aberrant crypts (22/30) compared to normal crypts (3/50). The immunohistochemical results demonstrate the presence of elevated levels of ras p21 in the same tissue as increased levels of ras-specific message. This investigation provides the earliest demonstration of increased expression of the ras oncogene in precursor lesions of colon cancer possessing dysplastic features.","title":"Expression of ras oncogene mRNA and protein in aberrant crypt foci.","pubmedId":"1423846"}
