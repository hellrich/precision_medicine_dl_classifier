To investigate the potential roles of p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) genes in human renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), we analyzed 6 human RCC cell lines and 91 primary RCCs for homozygous deletion, promoter hypermethylation and expression of the p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) gene products using differential PCR, methylation-specific PCR, and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Five cell lines showed homozygous co-deletion of both genes and one demonstrated promoter hypermethylation of the p16(INK4a) gene only. Eight of 91 RCCs showed aberrations of p14(ARF) or p16(INK4a) status and six of these featured gross extension into the renal vein. The results suggest that p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) aberrations may play roles in the relatively late stage of renal tumorigenesis associated with tumor progression.","title":"Aberrations of the p14(ARF) and p16(INK4a) genes in renal cell carcinomas.","pubmedId":"11749694"}
