Therefore, efforts to alter the patterns of recurrence and improve survival for patients with pancreatic cancer currently focus on the delivery of systemic therapy and irradiation before or after surgery. Postoperative adjuvant therapy appears to improve median survival. However, more than one-fourth of patients do not complete planned adjuvant therapy due to surgical complications or a delay in postoperative recovery of performance status. Utilizing a preoperative (neoadjuvant) approach, overall treatment time is reduced, a greater proportion of patients receive all components of therapy, and patients with rapidly progressive disease are spared the side effects of surgery as metastatic disease may be found at restaging following chemoradiation (prior to surgery). This paper examines the factors pertinent to clinical trial design for resectable pancreatic cancer, and carefully reviews the existing data supporting adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy for potentially resectable disease.","title":"Localized adenocarcinoma of the pancreas: the rationale for preoperative chemoradiation.","pubmedId":"11854545"}
