In addition, LSEP specifically contain transferrin receptor whereas LSLP possess relatively more rabaptin-5. In contrast to LSLP, late-Salmonella-containing vacuoles in epithelial cells show significantly reduced levels of Rab5 and EEA1. Subsequent results demonstrate that both phagosomes efficiently fuse with early endosomes (EE). In contrast to LSEP, fusion between LSLP and EE is insensitive to ATPgammaS treatment. Furthermore, LSLP fuses with EE in absence of NEM-sensitive fusion factor (NSF) as well as in the presence of NSF:D1EQ mutant demonstrating that LSLP fusion with EE is NSF independent.","title":"NSF independent fusion of Salmonella-containing late phagosomes with early endosomes.","pubmedId":"20176016"}
