The findings indicate that neither CEA nor MAA were diagnostically informative in malignant tumors of female genitals, and in uterine cervix cancer none of the tumor markers was diagnostically valuable. In neglected cases of uterine body cancer blood levels of CA-19-9 and CA-125 were elevated. In ovarian carcinoma CA-125 levels varied statistically significantly (p \u003c 0.05) in various stages of the disease. CA-125 measurements are recommended for monitoring the treatment efficacy in patients with ovarian cancer.","title":"[The use of tumor markers in the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of malignant tumors of the female genitalia].","pubmedId":"8250120"}
