From January 1998 to December 2003, 19 patients were operated on at our department for obstructing colorectal cancer. Thirteen patients underwent one-stage operation with immediate anastomosis without diversion, while 6 patients were managed palliatively. We performed resection and anastomosis following intraoperative irrigation in obstructing sigmoid cancer without colonic wall lesions, while subtotal colectomy was carried out in case of massively distended colon with ischemic lesions. Colostomy was indicated in 6 high-risk patients with unresectable lesions. In case of obstructing left colorectal cancer, an experienced surgeon can perform one-stage resection and anastomosis on good general status patients, conversely defunctioning colostomy may be ideal for surgeons with little experience in colorectal surgery and in very poor prognosis patients.","title":"One-stage treatment in emergency setting for obstructing colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"16437958"}
