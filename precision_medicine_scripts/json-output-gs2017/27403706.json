Patients with BRAFv600 mutations can be treated with a combination of a BRAF-inhibitor and an MEK-inhibitor. Patients with BRAF wild-type tumors and BRAFv600 mutated tumors can be treated with immunotherapy i.e. check point inhibitors.\nWe conducted a comprehensive review of the literature on the efficacy and predictive markers, safety, and pharmacoeconomics of ipilimumab in melanoma Expert commentary: Ipilimumab was the first check point inhibitor reaching the clinic, gaining FDA and EMA approval for metastatic melanoma in 2011. Ipilimumab was also approved by FDA in the adjuvant setting for patients with high risk, stage III melanoma. The anti-PD1 directed antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab are superior to single agent ipilimumab, which is no longer considered the standard first line treatment in metastatic melanoma. The addition ipilimumab to nivolumab is associated with a higher response rate and a better PFS, particularly in patients with PD-L1 negative tumors, albeit at the cost of a steep increase in grade 3-4 adverse event rate. Definitive survival data on this combination are pending and the selection of patients potentially requiring the combination and its pharmacoeconomic implications are to be elucidated.","title":"Ipilimumab in melanoma.","pubmedId":"27403706"}
