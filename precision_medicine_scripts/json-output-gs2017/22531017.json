This new technique has generated strong interest among surgeons worldwide. However, single-port laparoscopic colon surgery has not yet been standardized. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the feasibility of single-port laparoscopic colectomy compared with conventional laparoscopic colectomy for colon cancer.\nWe conducted a case-matched, controlled study comparing single-port laparoscopic colectomy to conventional laparoscopic colectomy for right-sided colon cancer.\nA total of ten patients were included for the single-port laparoscopic colectomy (S-LAC) group and ten patients for the conventional laparoscopic colectomy (C-LAC) group. The length of the skin incision in the S-LAC group was significantly shorter than that of the C-LAC group.\nOur early experiences indicated that S-LAC for right-sided colon cancer is a feasible and safe procedure and that S-LAC results in a better cosmetic outcome.","title":"Single-port laparoscopic colectomy versus conventional laparoscopic colectomy for colon cancer: a comparison of surgical results.","pubmedId":"22531017"}
