The objective of the present study was to characterize the expression of two hepatotrophic growth factor/receptor systems [transforming growth factor-alpha/epidermal growth factor receptor (TGF-alpha/EGFR) and hepatocyte growth factor/c-met receptor (HGF/c-met)], both of which are implicated in the development of human liver tumors. In addition, we have analyzed the expression of transforming growth factor-beta receptor type II (TGF-beta-RII) and p53, genes associated with growth inhibition and tumor suppression, respectively. Surgical biopsy specimens from 86 human hepatocellular carcinomas were analyzed. TGF-alpha was overexpressed in 17%, equally expressed in 21%, and down-regulated in 62% of the hepatocellular carcinomas when compared to the surrounding hepatic tissue. No major changes were found with EGFR expression. HGF was over-expressed in 33% and down-regulated in 21% of the tumors. The c-met receptor was overexpressed in 20%, equally expressed in 48%, and down-regulated in 32% of the neoplasms. In contrast, TGF-beta-RII was overexpressed in only 8%, equal in 42%, and down-regulated in 50% of tumors. Nuclear staining of p53, indicative of a mutation(s), was observed in the great majority of the tumors (80%), whereas no nuclear p53 was detected in peritumoral tissues. Interestingly, simultaneous down-regulation of c-met and TGF-beta-RII was observed in 23% of the hepatocellular carcinomas, 85% of which also showed nuclear p53 staining. Taken together, our data suggest that down-regulation of c-met and TGF-beta-RII may, together with p53 mutations, play a significant role in human liver carcinogenesis.","title":"Analysis of transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha/epidermal growth factor receptor, hepatocyte growth Factor/c-met,TGF-beta receptor type II, and p53 expression in human hepatocellular carcinomas.","pubmedId":"9815784"}
