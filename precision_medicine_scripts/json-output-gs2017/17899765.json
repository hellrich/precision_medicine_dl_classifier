The proliferation of colon cancer cells were determined by MTT assay and COX-2 protein expression were detected by Western blot. Total RNA was isolated from three kinds of colon cancer cell lines; the expressions of NAG-1 mRNA in the cells treated with or without NSAIDs were assessed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Celecoxib, meloxicam and aspirin were able to inhibit the growth of HT-29, SW480 and LS174-T cells in dose-dependent manner. COX-2 protein expressed in HT-29 and LS174-T, but not in SW480 cells. All of colon cancer cells expressed NAG-1 gene and the level of LS174-T was lower than that of the other two cell lines. NAG-1 expression was increased by treatment with some NSAIDs in all three kinds of colon cancer cells. NSAIDs were able to potentially inhibit the growth of colon cell lines. Induction of NAG-1 gene expression by NSAID was not consistent with COX-2 expression.","title":"[Induction of NAG-1 gene expression in colon cancer cells by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs].","pubmedId":"17899765"}
