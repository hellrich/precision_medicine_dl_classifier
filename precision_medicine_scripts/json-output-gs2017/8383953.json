The practice of multidisciplinary breast cancer treatment has become the standard of care for the majority of breast cancer patients. If the surgeon is to retain the primary coordinating role in breast cancer management, then he or she must fully understand all modalities of oncology therapy and know how to deploy them to benefit individual patients.\nThis article provides a framework for making clinical decisions about the appropriate combination and sequence of treatment for various presentations of early breast cancer.","title":"Clinical decision-making in early breast cancer.","pubmedId":"8383953"}
