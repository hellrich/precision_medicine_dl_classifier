Malignant mesotheliomas were immunoreactive for N-cadherin (26/29; 90%), met (29/29; 100%) and erbB-2 (28/29; 97%). Focal immunoreactivity was present for E-cadherin in epithelioid or mixed tumours (14/25; 56%), and for HGF/SF (9/24; 38%).\nExpression of N-cadherin supports the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma and use of appropriate antibodies would be a useful addition to a diagnostic antibody panel. Focal staining for E-cadherin does not exclude mesothelioma. Signalling pathways mediated via met and erbB-2 may play a role in the growth and spread of malignant mesotheliomas.","title":"Immunoreactivity for cadherins, HGF/SF, met, and erbB-2 in pleural malignant mesotheliomas.","pubmedId":"10849094"}
