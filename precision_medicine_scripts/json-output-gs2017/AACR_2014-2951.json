Here, we report that KRAS or BRAF mutant cells exhibit a significant increase in the uptake of oxidized vitamin C, dehydroascorbate (DHA), via the GLUT1 glucose transporter. Increased uptake of DHA in the mutant cell lines causes oxidative stress as intracellular DHA is immediately reduced back to vitamin C by reduced glutathione. Elevated reactive oxygen species inactivate GAPDH and thus divert glycolytic flux into the pentose phosphate pathway. Because KRAS or BRAF mutant cells are highly dependent on glycolysis, this altered glucose metabolism induced by vitamin C ultimately leads to an energy deficit in KRAS or BRAF mutant cells and thereby cell death. There are currently a growing number of clinical trials in phases I/II examining the effect of high dose vitamin C as a treatment for cancers, including colorectal cancers. Our results provide a rationale for the pharmacological use of vitamin C as a therapeutic agent to treat colorectal cancer patients with oncogenic KRAS or BRAF mutations.","title":"Vitamin C is selectively toxic to cancer cells harboring KRAS or BRAF mutations by targeting GAPDH","pubmedId":"AACR_2014-2951"}
