Despite many clinical trials of platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with various drugs, the median survival time of NSCLC patients remains poor. The overall 5-year survival rate is approximately 15%, and has improved only marginally over the last few decades despite the introduction of new therapeutic agents. A recent milestone in this field has been the development of molecular-targeting drugs, among which gefitinib and erlotinib targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have improved the efficacy of therapy for NSCLC. Anti-angiogenetic drug, such as bevacizumab, had become clinical use in the treatment for NSCLC. Moreover, discovery of EML4-ALK made the marvelous progress in cancer research in NSCLC. In this review, we discuss about the development of molecular-targeting drugs, such as EGFR-TKI, anti-angiogenetic drug, and EMLA-ALK inhibitors.","title":"[Molecular targeted therapy in lung cancer].","pubmedId":"20954328"}
