Intra-arterial chemotherapy was given by subcutaneous implantable drug delivery system with infusion of cisplatin and doxorubicin followed by caffeine. After treatment, patients were followed up for 39 months. The liposarcoma changes in CT imaging were observed in 18 cases and there were 15 cases with medium or severe pathological changes caused by chemotherapy. At the end of the postoperative follow-up of 39 months, liposarcoma reoccurred locally in 2 cases; pulmonary metastasis occurred in 1 case and death in 3 cases. Preoperative intra-arterial chemotherapy is effective for highly malignant tumors such as recurrent liposarcoma and the judgment of prognosis is based on the postoperative pathological changes of such tumor.","title":"The significance of preoperative chemotherapy in evaluation of recurrent soft tissue liposarcoma necrosis.","pubmedId":"22173612"}
