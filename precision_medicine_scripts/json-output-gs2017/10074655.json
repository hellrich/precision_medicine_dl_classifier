An emphasis has been placed on developing more effective chemotherapy regimens; currently, fluorouracil is the standard single agent used for gastric cancer. Radiation therapy has been used for palliative symptom management.\nAn understanding of current treatment modalities for gastric cancer will help oncology nurses assist their patients throughout their course of treatment with education, nutritional support, and symptom control.","title":"Gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"10074655"}
