The patients were randomly admitted to six hospitals and treated according to different protocols, based on the policy of each hospital. Our conclusions are that in stage I of the disease, radical prophylactic lymph-node dissection (RPLND) improved the prognosis in all three levels of tumor invasion into the skin; in stage II of the disease, RPLND did not improve the prognosis when compared to wide excision of the tumor and excision of the clinically involved nodes; and in stage I of the disease, there is no statistically significant difference in prognosis between excisional biopsy and wide excision of the tumor.","title":"Treatment of cutaneous malignant melanoma in Israel, 1960 to 1970.","pubmedId":"7114748"}
