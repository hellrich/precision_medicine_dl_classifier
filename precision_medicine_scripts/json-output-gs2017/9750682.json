Preoperatively she had been treated with doxorubicin (Adriamycin) 450 mg.m-2, total dose, associated with breast and ovarian radiotherapy. This association was probably the cause of postoperative heart failure. Twenty-four hours after surgery, a two-dimensional echocardiography showed a severe left ventricular dysfunction, whereas preoperative clinical assessment was unremarkable. Doxorubicin cardiotoxicity can be acute, subacute and delayed as in our case. Clinical assessment and ECG are not sensitive indicators of such cardiac damage. Preoperative echography is the technique of choice for the evaluation of the cardiac status of a patient treated with a high cumulative dose of doxorubicin and mediastinal irradiation.","title":"[Acute cardiogenic postoperative edema after doxorubicin (adriamycin) chemotherapy].","pubmedId":"9750682"}
