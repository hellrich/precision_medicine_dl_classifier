However, the median time to progression on cabazitaxel is 2.8 months. We aimed to determine whether DNA methylation plays a role in cabazitaxel resistance.\nDU145 cells, resistant to docetaxel and cabaxitaxel (DU145 10DRCR), were generated from cells resistant to 10 nM docetaxel (DU145 10DR). The effect of pre-treatment with 5-azacytidine was determined with regards to cabazitaxel sensitivity. Gene expression profiling was carried-out on DU145 10DR, DU145 10DRCR and DU145 10DRCR treated with 5-azacytidine.\nPre-treatment of cells with 5-azacytidine resulted in enhanced sensitivity to cabazitaxel. Gene expression profiling identified a subset of genes that may be regulated by DNA methylation.\nOur results indicate that DNA methylation of pro-apoptotic and cell-cycle regulatory genes may contribute to cabazitaxel resistance and pre-treatment with 5-azacytidine may restore sensitivity to cabazitaxel in prostate cancer cells.","title":"Role of DNA Methylation in Cabazitaxel Resistance in Prostate Cancer.","pubmedId":"26722040"}
