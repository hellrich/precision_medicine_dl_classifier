PTEN expression was similar in benign mammary tumours and normal mammary tissues (P\u003e0.05), but was lower in malignant tumours than in normal mammary tissues or benign mammary tumours (P\u003c0.001). PTEN expression was also low in the lymph node metastases of malignant mammary tumours. The expression profile of PTEN in malignant mammary tumours compared to those without lymph node metastasis varied significantly. Low-level PETN expression might play an important role in carcinogenesis and the progression of canine mammary tumours, and PTEN protein detection might be useful in evaluating tumour development and prognosis.","title":"Expression and significance of PTEN in canine mammary gland tumours.","pubmedId":"18082231"}
