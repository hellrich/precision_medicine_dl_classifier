She was then treated with maintenance bevacizumab for a total of 42 cycles, the total dose of bevacizumab is 44,730 mg. The progression-free survival was 39 months. Our findings suggest that maintenance bevacizumab for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is safe and its benefit for long-term survival overwhelms its side effects.\n本文报道1例女性肺腺癌患者，表皮生长因子受体（epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR）、V-Ki-ras2鼠Kirsten肉瘤病毒致癌基因同源物（V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, KRAS）基因突变及棘皮动物微管相关类蛋白4与间变性淋巴瘤激酶融合基因（chinodem microtubule-associated protein-like 4/anaplastic lymphoma kinase, EML4-ALK）检测结果均为阴性；一线接受贝伐珠单抗（15 mg/kg）联合常规剂量紫杉醇、卡铂方案6周期化疗以及后续贝伐珠单抗的维持治疗。共应用贝伐珠单抗42周期，应用总剂量达44,730 mg，患者的无进展生存期（progression-free survival, PFS）长达39个月，患者的长期生存获益远超出了不良反应所带来的危害。","title":"[Long-term survival of a patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer on bevacizumab therapy: case report and review of the literature].","pubmedId":"23769349"}
