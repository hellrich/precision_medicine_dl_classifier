Approximately 30% to 40% of patients with colorectal cancer have locoregionally advanced or metastatic disease on presentation and cannot be cured with surgical therapy. After many years without significant change, systemic therapy for colorectal cancer is rapidly evolving. The past decade has seen the introduction of new chemotherapeutic agents such as irinotecan (Camptosar), oxaliplatin (Eloxatin) and the oral 5-FU prodrug capecitabine (Xeloda). Combination studies of these new agents with the standard 5-FU/leucovorin have extended median survival in patients with advanced colorectal cancer for up to 21 months. In addition, targeted agents with activity in colorectal cancer have emerged and are promising. This article reviews the current treatment recommendations for patients who present with advanced colorectal cancer. Survival in patients with advanced colorectal cancer is on a positive trajectory. The hope that some patients with advanced disease will be long-term survivors (even without surgery) appears to be within the range of possibility.","title":"Current strategies in previously untreated advanced colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"15214592"}
