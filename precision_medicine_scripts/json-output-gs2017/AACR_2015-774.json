Cabozantinib (CABO) is a multi-target inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases including VEGFR, MET, RET, and KIT. We aimed to evaluate the anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor effect of CABO alone and in combination with the standard-of-care cytotoxic agent doxorubicin (DOX) in a patient-derived xenograft model of dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS).Methods: NMRI nu/nu mice were bilaterally transplanted with human UZLX-STS3 DDLPS tumors, a model originating from a patient with DDLPS. Twenty eight tumor-bearing mice were assigned to 4 groups and treated for three weeks with either vehicle (control), DOX (i.p., 1.2mg/kg/twice per week), CABO (p.o., 30mg/kg/QD) or CABO+DOX (same dose/schedule as for the single agents). Tumor volume was measured three times a week. Mitotic and apoptotic activity were assessed on hematoxylin and eosin (H\u0026E) staining and with phospho-histone H3 (pHH3) and cleaved-caspase 3 (CC3) immunostainings. Microvascular density (MVD) was evaluated by counting CD34 positive vessels. Statistics were calculated using the Mann-Whitney U pairs tests. p \u003c 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.Results: A significant delay in tumor growth was observed in CABO and CABO+DOX treated groups as compared to controls (p\u003c0.05) or DOX single agent (p\u003c0.05). Both CABO and CABO+DOX reduced the mitotic activity in comparison with control (38% and 66% decrease, respectively, p\u003c0.005). CABO+DOX showed better antimitotic activity than either single agent DOX or CABO (p\u003c0.005 for both). The CABO-based treatments induced higher apoptotic activity as compared to control (2.1 fold in CABO and 2.4 fold in CABO+DOX, p\u003c0.005). Results were confirmed by pHH3 and CC3 stainings. Furthermore, significantly decreased MVD was observed in the CABO and the combination treated tumors as compared to control (64% and 67% decrease, respectively, p\u003c0.005) and as compared to DOX alone (57% and 61% decrease, respectively, p\u003c0.005).Conclusions: CABO has anti-tumor activity in the UZLX-STS3 DDLPS xenograft model by inhibiting proliferation, inducing apoptosis and suppressing angiogenesis. These in vivo results support ongoing and planned clinical trials with cabozantinib in mesenchymal malignancies.","title":"Cabozantinib, a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, decreases tumor growth and angiogenesis in a patient-derived dedifferentiated liposarcoma xenograft","pubmedId":"AACR_2015-774"}
