We examined 19 bladder cancer cell lines derived from 17 patients for alterations in TP53, RB1, CDKN2A, and ARF. Twelve cell lines had a mutation in exons 5-11 of TP53 and, with only one exception, a concomitant loss of RB1 protein expression. Another group of seven cell lines had a wild-type TP53 gene or a mutation in exons 1-4 of TP53 and concomitant alterations in both CDKN2A and ARF in every case. This demonstrates the requirement, in all but one line, for inactivation of both the CDKN2A/RB1 and ARF/TP53 pathways in bladder cancer cell lines and provides the first evidence for potential differences in the penetrance of mutations in the transactivation and DNA-binding domains of TP53.","title":"Presence and location of TP53 mutation determines pattern of CDKN2A/ARF pathway inactivation in bladder cancer.","pubmedId":"9850064"}
