Relationships between clinicopathological factors including intratumoral TS, DPD, or OPRT expressions and survival was evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis.\nHigh intratumoral DPD, OPRT, and TS expressions were found in 19 (37%), 30 (58%), and 23 (44%) of cases, respectively. Patients with high TS expression had more advanced-stage disease than those with low TS expression. Univariate analysis revealed that gender, perineural invasion, lymph node status, UICC pT factor, UICC stage, OPRT expression, and TS expression correlated significantly (P \u003c 0.05) with disease-specific survival. Only perineural invasion (P \u003d 0.043) and TS expression (P \u003d 0.019) were independent prognostic factors of disease-specific survival by multivariate survival analysis. Five-year disease-specific survival rates of patients with high and low intratumoral TS expression were 47% and 91%, respectively.\nIntratumoral TS expression level may be a potent predictor of prognosis after surgical resection for ampullary carcinoma.","title":"Impact of intratumoral thymidylate synthase expression on prognosis after surgical resection for ampullary carcinoma.","pubmedId":"21360535"}
