In this study, we characterized actionable targets in patients with recurrent bile duct- and pancreatic cancer included in a large prospective cohort of solid tumors pts with exhausted treatment options. Pts were included in early clinical trials based on genomic profiling of their tumors. Methods: Pts with bile duct- and pancreatic cancer, included in the Copenhagen Prospective Personalized Oncology (CoPPO) research program had their tumor re-biopsied. Tissue was stored in RNAlater for DNA and RNA purification and as FFPE specimens for histological verification. Tumor DNA was analyzed by CytoScanHD array (Affymetrix) to identify copy number changes and by whole exome sequencing (Illumina HiSeq2500) to call tumor specific mutations. RNA expression levels and chromosomal translocations of therapeutic targets were analyzed by expression arrays and RNA-Seq (Nugens Ovation RNA-Seq system v2). Pts were allocated to targeted therapy according to a consensus reached at bi-weekly tumor board meetings. Results: Among 300+ pts included in the CoPPO research program since May 2013, 20 pts had bile duct cancer and 27 pancreatic cancers. Most frequently mutated genes in bile duct cancers were TP53 (25%), IDH1/2 (25%), KRAS (20%), BRAF (20%), and APC (15%). In contrast, significantly higher frequencies of KRAS (85%) and TP53 (78%) mutations (p \u003c 0.0001, 2 test) and no IDH1/2 mutations were recorded in pancreatic cancers. The majority of bile duct cancer pts (65%) had actionable targets, including IDH1/2, BRAF, MET, FGFR, BRCA2, and NOTCH,of which 40% were included in clinical trials. In pancreatic cancer, actionable targets (BRCA1, MET, NOTCH, BRAF) were identified in only 19% of pts of whom 30% entered a trial. Major reasons for failure to include pts in clinical trials were reduced performance status and unavailability of targeted therapy (IDH1/2). Conclusions: The genomic landscape of bile duct cancers seems distinctly different from pancreatic cancers. A higher frequency of actionable targets was observed in bile duct cancer.
