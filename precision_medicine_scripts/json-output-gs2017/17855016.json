Young age continues to evolve as a potentially important risk factor. The objective of this study was to assess the benefits of PMRT in patients \u003c35 years old treated with doxorubicin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy for Stage II-III breast cancer.\nWe retrospectively analyzed 107 consecutive breast cancer patients \u003c35 years old with Stage IIA-IIIC disease treated at our institution with doxorubicin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and mastectomy, with or without PMRT. The treatment groups were compared in terms of LRC and overall survival.\nDespite more advanced disease stages, the patients who received PMRT (n \u003d 80) had greater rates of LRC (5-year rate, 88% vs. 63%, p \u003d 0.001) and better overall survival (5-year rate, 67% vs. 48%, p \u003d 0.03) than patients who did not receive PMRT (n \u003d 27).\nAmong breast cancer patients \u003c35 years old at diagnosis, the use of PMRT after doxorubicin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and mastectomy led to a statistically greater rate of LRC and overall survival compared with patients without PMRT. The benefit seen for PMRT in young patients provides valuable data to better tailor adjuvant, age-specific treatment decisions after mastectomy.","title":"Effect of postmastectomy radiotherapy in patients \u003c35 years old with stage II-III breast cancer treated with doxorubicin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and mastectomy.","pubmedId":"17855016"}
