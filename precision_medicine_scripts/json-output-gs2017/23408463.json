Islets of malignant cells were visually located on the archived cytological slides, lysed in situ by a drop of sodium dodecyl sulfate-containing buffer, and subjected to the standard DNA and RNA extraction. Examination of paraffin-embedded tissue blocks (resection specimens or biopsy material) from the same patients was performed in parallel.\nA total of 75 cytological/histological lung adenocarcinoma sample pairs underwent polymerase chain reaction analysis for the EGFR mutation. Two cytological samples and 1 morphological sample failed to produce DNA. Concordance for the wild-type and mutation status was observed in 54 of 72 and 14 of 72 informative pairs, respectively; 3 pairs and 1 pair, respectively, had mutation only in the cytological or histological material. The discrepancies could be explained by the failure to ensure a high percentage of lung cancer cells in the analyzed samples or, alternatively, by the genuine intratumoral molecular heterogeneity of some neoplasms. RNA extraction followed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis for the EML4-ALK translocation was performed for 44 EGFR mutation-negative sample pairs; failures were observed for 2 cytological and 6 histological specimens. All informative pairs were concordant either for the norm (32 of 36 pairs) or for the presence of EML4-ALK gene fusion (4 of 36 pairs).\nArchived cytological slides appear to be well suited both for EGFR and ALK analysis.","title":"Detection of EGFR mutations and EML4-ALK rearrangements in lung adenocarcinomas using archived cytological slides.","pubmedId":"23408463"}
