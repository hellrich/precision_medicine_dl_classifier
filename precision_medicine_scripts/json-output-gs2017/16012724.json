To further examine the functional role of this genetic polymorphism at the population level, we assessed the presence of the Arg388 allele in 142 breast carcinoma patients, 179 colorectal carcinoma patients and 220 general population controls with respect to an association with cancer prognosis and/or risk. No significant association with cancer risk, survival or any other prognostic parameters was observed in either breast or colorectal cancer. A pooled analysis of the present and published data on nodal status by FGFR4 genotypes revealed no association in either breast cancer [odds ratio (OR), 1.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.7-1.4; 702 subjects] or colorectal cancer (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.6-3.4; 260 cases). Thus, the FGFR4 polymorphism may not be relevant in predicting nodal involvement of breast cancer or colon cancer patients.","title":"FGFR4 Gly388Arg polymorphism and prognosis of breast and colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"16012724"}
