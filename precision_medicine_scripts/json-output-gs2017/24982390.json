V-KI-RAS2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations are more common in smokers. These molecular lesions were usually described as are mutually exclusive. We herein describe a rare case of co-existence of ALK and KRAS abnormalities in adenocarcinoma tumor with massive local growth (disproportionality of clinical symptoms) and rapid central nervous system (CNS) metastases spread. T3N1M0 stage tumor (size: 10×12×13 cm) in upper lobe of the right lung was diagnosed in a 56-year-old Caucasian male smoker. Adenocarcinoma of solid predominant was surgically resected with chest wall reconstruction. One month after surgery, CNS metastases were diagnosed and subsequently treated with radiotherapy. We noted an 8-month overall survival from tumor resection. In the case of comorbidity of disorders in the ALK (uncertain prognostic significance) and KRAS gene (described as unfavorable prognostic factor), these abnormalities may ultimately decide the course of the disease in the form of brain metastases.
