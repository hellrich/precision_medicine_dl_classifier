In recent immunohistochemical studies, we observed strong staining of the newly identified human kallikreins 6 and 10 (hK6 and hK10) in the islets of Langerhans. Here, we examine hK6 and hK10 immunoexpression in different types of islet cells of the endocrine pancreas, in order to obtain clues for hK6 and hK10 function in these cells. Ten cases of normal pancreatic tissue, two cases of nesidioblastosis, five insulin-producing tumours and one case of multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 syndrome, containing an insulin-, a somatostatin- and several glucagon-producing tumours, as well as tiny foci of endocrine dysplasia with different predominance of the secreted hormones (mainly glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide) were included in the study. A streptavidin--biotin--peroxidase and an alkaline phosphatase protocol, as well as a sequential immunoenzymatic double staining method were performed, using specific antibodies against hK6, hK10, insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide, and serotonin. hK6 and hK10 immunoexpression was observed in the islets of Langerhans, including the pancreatic polypeptide-rich islets, in the normal pancreas. Scattered hK6 and hK10 positive cells were localized in relationship with pancreatic acinar cells. In the exocrine pancreas, a cytoplasmic and/or brush border hK6 and hK10 immunoexpression was observed in the median and small sized pancreatic ducts, while the acinar cells were negative. Foci of nesidioblastosis and endocrine dysplasia expressed both kallikreins. hK6 and hK10 were also strongly and diffusely expressed throughout all insulin-, glucagon- and somatostatin-producing tumours. The double staining method revealed co-localization of each hormone and hK6/hK10 respectively, in the same cellular population, in the normal as well as in the diseased pancreas. Our results support the view that hK6 and hK10 may be involved in insulin and other pancreatic hormone processing and/or secretion, as well as in physiological functions related to the endocrine pancreas.","title":"Immunohistochemical localization of human kallikreins 6 and 10 in pancreatic islets.","pubmedId":"12769263"}
