The methylation of the HIN-1 gene promoter was detected in gastric carcinoma cells and tissues using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium cell viability assay and flow cytometry were used to assess the changes in behaviors of gastric cancer cells with or without 5-aza-2\u0027-deoxycytidine treatment.\nHIN-1 was not expressed in 4 of 5 gastric cancer cell lines. The demethylation reagent 5-aza-2\u0027-deoxycytidine was able to induce or upregulate HIN-1 expression in gastric cancer cell lines, which is associated with reduction of tumor cell viability. Furthermore, methylation of the HIN-1 gene promoter was shown in 57.8% (26/45) of the primary gastric cancer and 42.1% (17/38) of adjacent tissue samples, but was not shown in normal gastric mucosa (0/10). From the clinicopathological data of the patients, methylation of the HIN-1 gene promoter was found to be associated with tumor differentiation (P \u003d 0.000).\nHigh methylation of HIN-1 gene promoter results in silence of HIN-1 expression in gastric cancer. 5-aza-2\u0027-deoxycytidine reverses HIN-1 methylation and reduces viability of gastric cancer cells.","title":"Silence of HIN-1 expression through methylation of its gene promoter in gastric cancer.","pubmedId":"21274384"}
