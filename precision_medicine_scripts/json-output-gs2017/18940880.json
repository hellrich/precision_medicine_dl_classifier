In both SNPs, the association was suggested to be stronger in T1D complicated with AITD (Graves\u0027 disease, Hashimoto\u0027s thyroiditis, or thyroid autoantibodies). Furthermore, a joint analysis, with the INS and CTLA4 SNPs, revealed that CTLA4 rs3087243, ERBB3 rs2292399, and CLEC16A rs2903692, but not INS rs689, were significant risk factors for the cooccurrence of AITD in Japanese T1D.\nWe confirmed two loci on 12q13 and 16p13 that were identified by the independent genome-wide association studies in white populations, thus suggesting that these loci contribute to T1D susceptibility across different ethnic groups. In addition, these loci may also be associated with the cooccurrence of thyroid autoimmunity in T1D.","title":"Association of type 1 diabetes with two Loci on 12q13 and 16p13 and the influence coexisting thyroid autoimmunity in Japanese.","pubmedId":"18940880"}
