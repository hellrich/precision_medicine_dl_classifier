There was no limit of language or time. A meta-analysis was performed for retrieved literatures meeting the inclusion criteria.\nA total of 1 794 breast cancer patients from 5 clinical trials were included. And the regimens were lapatinib plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n \u003d 719), trastuzumab plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n \u003d 714) and both drugs plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n \u003d 361). The rate of pathological complete remission (pCR) was lower in lapatinib group than that in trastuzumab group (28.2% vs 35.4%). And the difference was statistically significant (P \u003d 0.004). The pCR rate was significantly higher in lapatinib plus trastuzumab therapy group than that in trastuzumab group (53.2% vs 38.1%, P \u003c 0.001).\nLapatinib can not replace trastuzumab as a first-choice agent in neoadjuvant therapy of HER-2 positive breast cancer. Lapatinib plus trastuzumab achieves better pCR than trastuzumab so that it and may become a first-choice of neoadjuvant therapy for HER-2 positive breast cancer regardless of economic affordability for patients.","title":"[Efficacy of lapatinib versus trastuzumab in neoadjuvant therapy of HER-2 positive breast cancer: a meta-analysis].","pubmedId":"25623322"}
