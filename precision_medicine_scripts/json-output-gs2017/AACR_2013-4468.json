However, patients invariably develop resistance through secondary EGFR mutations, c-MET amplification, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), small cell lung cancer transformation, PIK3CA mutation and other unknown mechanisms. Here we examined whether Cripto1, which has been shown to induce EMT, could cause erlotinib resistance. We show that innate erlotinib-resistant lung adenocarcinomas carrying sensitizing EGFR mutations exhibit higher level of Cripto1 expression than their erlotinib sensitive counterparts. Ectopic expression of Cripto1 rendered erlotinib-sensitive lung adenocarcinoma cells resistant to erlotinib both in vitro and in a xenograft model. Moreover, Cripto1 activated Zeb1/EMT signaling pathway in EGFR-TKI resistant cells. High Cripto1 expression correlated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. Our study provides a novel Cripto1-dependent mechanism of EGFR-TKI resistance that may pave the way for the development of therapies to overcome EGFR-TKI resistance in lung cancer patients.","title":"Cripto-1 elicits innate resistance to EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR-sensitizing mutations.","pubmedId":"AACR_2013-4468"}
