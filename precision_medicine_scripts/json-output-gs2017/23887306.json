Recent findings point to microvesicular hyperplastic polyps that have similar histologic and molecular features to sessile serrated adenomas/polyps, as potential colorectal carcinoma precursors. The aim of this study was to evaluate BRAF V600E mutation status by immunohistochemistry in serrated lesions of the colon with regard to histomorphology. We investigated 194 serrated lesions of the colon, comprising 42 sessile serrated adenomas/polyps, 16 traditional serrated adenomas, 136 hyperplastic polyps and 20 tubular/tubulovillous adenomas (conventional adenomas) with the novel BRAF V600E mutation-specific antibody VE1. In addition, BRAF exon 15 and KRAS exon 2 status was investigated by capillary sequencing in selected cases. All sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (42/42, 100%), 15/16 (94%) traditional serrated adenomas and 84/136 (62%) hyperplastic polyps were VE1+. None of the VE1- serrated lesions showed BRAF V600E mutation. Forty out of 42 (95%) sessile serrated adenomas/polyps displayed areas with microvesicular hyperplastic polyp-like features. In microvesicular hyperplastic polyps, VE1 positivity was significantly associated with nuclear atypia (P\u003d0.003); however, nuclear atypia was also present in VE1- cases. Immunostaining with VE1 allows not only the detection of BRAF V600E mutation but also the correlation with histomorphology on a cellular level in serrated lesions. VE1 enables a subclassification of microvesicular hyperplastic polyps according to the mutation status. This improved classification of serrated lesions including immunohistochemical evaluation of BRAF V600E mutation may be the key to identify lesions with higher potential to progression into sessile serrated adenoma/polyp, and further to BRAF V600E-mutated colorectal cancer.
