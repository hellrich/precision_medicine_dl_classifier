Vaginal examination revealed an elastic-soft mass beneath the anterior vaginal wall. Urine cytology was positive. Urethrocystoscopy, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic scan revealed a localized urethral diverticular tumor. Transurethral resection of the tumor was performed and the histopathologic finding was adenocarcinoma. Transvaginal urethral diverticulectomy was performed. Histopathological examination showed that the tumor arose in the urethral diverticulum and the proximal margin was positive. She had local recurrence at six months after the operation, and cystourethrectomy was performed. Six months after the operation, she had no evidence of recurrence. We review 18 cases of urethral diverticular carcinoma in Japan.","title":"[A case of adenocarcinoma in female urethral diverticulum].","pubmedId":"17874555"}
