Not recognized in time, the survival probability is low. The 5-year survival time is 10% with a manifest gastric carcinoma, with colonic cancer it is 30%. If these neoplasias are recognized in a stage in which they correspond to the criteria of an early carcinoma, the chance of recovery will be 90% for the patients. The early gastric carcinoma does not occur without any symptoms, but in more than 80% of the cases it causes differently intensely pronounced symptoms in the epigastric region, with pain, dyspepsia, haemorrhage and loss of weight prevailing. Therefore, epigastric, complaint for more than 4 weeks should give reason for a thorough gastroenterological examination, with endoscopy being superior to radiological examination, even when using advanced methods of examination. Special control is needed for patients of the various risk groups. Patients with a morbus Ménétrie, a pernicious anaemia and a chronic-atrophic gastritis with intestinal metaplasia of the colonic type are exposed to a particularly high risk of carcinoma. Of a special practical importance is the circumstance that a peptic ulcus of the stomach may develop in an already carcinomatously changed mucosa and thus the carcinoma continues growing below a healed peptic lesion. Thus, a gastric ulcer requires a regular and short-term endoscopic control until its final macroscopic and histological healing. The malignant diseases of stomach and large intestine show an inverse behaviour over the past 20 years. The colonic carcinoma develops from an adenoma in 90% of the cases. In most of the cases, this development from the precursors is without any symptoms. Symptoms such as blood in the stools, abdominal pain, change in the action of the bowels, loss of weight, decrease in power and the like indicate already an advanced carcinoma. Among the laboratory tests, only the examination of the faeces for concealed haemorrhage is of some importance as a diagnostic test. The CEA test in not suitable therefore. As also larger adenomas bleed intermittently, there is the chance of recognizing also these prestages of carcinomas by regular examinations of the faeces. In contrast to the simple barium enema, the radiological examination in double contrast reveals changes of the mucosa of the colon up to a size of 1 cm in more than 80% of the cases. Coloscopy, however, is superior to X-ray examination, regarding both expressiveness and efficiency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","title":"[Early clinical diagnosis of stomach and large intestine cancer].","pubmedId":"3617781"}
