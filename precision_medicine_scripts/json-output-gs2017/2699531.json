The blocks were submitted to sodium hypochloride digestion followed by fiber identification in phase contrast light microscopy. The authors were able to demonstrate the presence of fibres in the three cases. The likelyhood of those carcinomas being caused by exposure to asbestos is very high, as two out of the three cases showed pulmonary fibrosis (cases 1 and 2) and the other case showed typical parietal pleural plaques at thoracotomy.","title":"[Asbestos and bronchogenic carcinoma: a search for fibers in the pulmonary tissue of 3 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma].","pubmedId":"2699531"}
