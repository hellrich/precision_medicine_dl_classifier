Gefitinib effectiveness was evaluated by both imaging studies and change in serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels.\nEGFR mutations were found in 33 patients (56%). Of these mutations, 17 were deletions around codons 746-750 and 15 were point mutations (12 at codon 858, three at other codons), and one was an insertion. EGFR mutations were significantly more prevalent in females, adenocarcinoma, and never-smokers. Gefitinib treatment resulted in tumor shrinkage and/or CEA decrease to less than half of the baseline level in 26 patients, tumor growth and/or CEA elevation in 24 patients, and gefitinib effect was not assessable in nine patients. Female, never-smoking patients with adenocarcinoma tended to respond better to gefitinib treatment. Gefitinib was effective in 24 of 29 patients with EGFR mutations, compared with two of 21 patients without mutations (P \u003c .0001). Of note, del746-750 might be superior to L858R mutations for prediction of gefitinib response. Patients with EGFR mutations survived for a longer period than those without the mutations after initiation of gefitinib treatment (P \u003d .0053).\nEGFR mutations were a good predictor of clinical benefit of gefitinib in this setting.","title":"Mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene predict prolonged survival after gefitinib treatment in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer with postoperative recurrence.","pubmedId":"15738541"}
