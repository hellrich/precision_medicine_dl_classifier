In our case, the tumor was resected without performing orchiectomy previously. The patient was managed by laparoscopic resection, before undergoing radical orchiectomy in the left inguinal region. To our knowledge, no case of laparoscopic resection for the recurrent liposarcoma has been described. In addition, the present case serves to demonstrate that radical orchiectomy with wide excision is needed for paratesticular tumor.","title":"Laparoscopic resection of metastatic pelvic liposarcoma.","pubmedId":"16953912"}
