Clinical, biochemical, and pathological features and follow up after resection were recorded. Patients with invasive malignant IPMT were matched with patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, according to age and TNM stages; survival rates after resection were compared.\nSurgical treatment for IPMT were pancreaticoduodenectomy (n\u003d46), distal (n\u003d14), total (n\u003d11), or segmentary (n\u003d2) pancreatectomy. The operative mortality rate was 4%. IPMT corresponded to in situ (n\u003d22) or invasive carcinoma (n\u003d51). In the latter group, 17 had lymph node metastases. Overall median survival was 47 months. Five year survival rates in patients with in situ and invasive carcinoma were 88% and 36%, respectively. On univariate analysis, abdominal pain, preoperative high serum carbohydrate antigen 19.9 concentrations, caudal localisation, invasive carcinoma, lymph node metastases, peripancreatic extension, and malignant relapse were associated with a fatal outcome. Using multivariate analysis, lymph node metastases were the only prognostic factor (OR 7.5; 95% CI: 3.4 to 16.4). Overall five year survival rate was higher in patients with malignant invasive IPMT compared with those with pancreatic ductal carcinoma (36 v 21%, p\u003d0.03), but was similar in the subset of stage II/III tumours.\nThe prognosis of patients with resected in situ/invasive stage I malignant IPMT is excellent. In contrast, prognosis of locally advanced forms is as poor as in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","title":"Prognosis of malignant intraductal papillary mucinous tumours of the pancreas after surgical resection.
