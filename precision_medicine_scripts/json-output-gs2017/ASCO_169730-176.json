We describe potentially targetable genomic alterations (ptGA) of BTC and impact of MTT in these patients (pts). Methods: From 2011 to 2015, 104 chemorefractory patients (pts) with BTC (62 IHC, 23 EHC, 15 GBC, 4 AM) were referred to molecular profiling at our institution. Archived tumor samples were analyzed using different panels (FoundationOne in 27, Amplicon-MiSeq in 25, MassARRAY-Sequenom in 23, Fusion-Nanostring in 31 and protein expression in 13) and pts were offered MTT in Phase 1 trials according to specific eligibility criteria and logistics. Results: Median age was 57 y (27-82); metastatic sites were liver (81%), nodes (43%) and lung (21%); median time to progression on first-line chemo was 5.1 months (m) (CI95% 4.1-6.3); 27% received 2 or more chemo lines. At least one ptGA was detected in 49% of the samples, with proportional increase according to the size and spectrum of gene alterations tested (p\u003c0.001). Type of ptGA differed across tumor types (see Table). Additional ptGA in IHC (BRAF D594, ERBB2 S310, RNF43 and BRCA2 mut) and EHC (BRAF G469 and ERBB2 S310 mut) were found in single cases. A total of 22 pts were enrolled in Phase 1 trials, 13 of them with a direct MTT (5 PI3K, 2 MEK, 2 MET, 2 IDH1, 1 ERBB2 and 1 FGFR inhibitor [inh]). Partial response was observed in 1 case (MET ampl IHC with MET inh) and prolonged stable disease in 3 pts (1 FGFR2 fusion IHC with FGFR inh; 1 IDH1 mut IHC with IDH1 inh; 1 NRAS mut GBC with MEK inh). Conclusions: The diverse landscape of ptGA in BTC is a rich source for MTT in early clinical trials, and has the potential to improve outcomes of individual pts. Expanding gene panels to identify these driver alterations (mut, ampl and fusions) is key for precision medicine in BTC.
