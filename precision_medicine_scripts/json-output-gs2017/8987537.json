Under phosphate-limiting conditions the product yield rises from 0.033 to 0.143 and the specific product formation rate rises from 0.004 h-1 to 0.007 h-1. Enhanced sophoroselipid synthesis is initiated by the decline of the specific activities of NAD- and NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.41 and 1.1.1.42) to 2% and 0% of the initial activities respectively. Constantly high specific activity of citrate synthase (EC 4.1.3.7) causes an accumulation of isocitrate and citrate in the mitochondria. Both acids are transported into the cytosol where citrate is cleaved by ATP: citrate lyase (EC 4.1.3.8) giving rise to acetyl-CoA, the precursor of fatty acid synthesis. The ATP: citrate lyase is unaffected by different energy charges; the apparent K(m) values for coenzyme A, ATP and citrate are 23 microM, 250 microM and 256 microM respectively. NADPH for fatty acid synthesis might be generated by further metabolism of oxaloacetate, the other product of the citrate-cleaving reaction, by oxidation of the isocitrate by the cytosolic NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase or via the hexose monophosphate shunt. A possible explanation for sophoroselipid formation during exponential growth is given.","title":"Initial steps of sophoroselipid biosynthesis by Candida bombicola ATCC 22214 grown on glucose.","pubmedId":"8987537"}
