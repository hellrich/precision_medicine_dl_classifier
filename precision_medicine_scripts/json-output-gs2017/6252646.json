The adequacy of the initial surgical procedure and histological grade of malignancy both influenced survival rates. In addition local recurrence was noted only in patients who had undergone \"inadequate\" initial excision. Inguinal lymph nodes were uninvolved by tumor in all cases. In general, patients with liposarcomas of myxoid and/or round cell type survived for long periods of time. However, even patients with myxoid lesions occasionally exhibited evidence of early blood-borne metastases. This study suggests an important relationship between an inadequate primary resection, local recurrence, and eventual retroperitoneal spread. In the majority of cases, this may have resulted from failure to control the primary distal extremity tumor, with subsequent contiguous spread of metastases into the ipsilateral retroperitoneal space. If feasible, radical soft part resection should be performed as the primary surgical therapy of these neoplasms. Tumors contiguous to the knee or ankle joint should be treated by primary amputation. Failure to control local disease may result in blood-borne dissemination or local spread along musculoaponeurotic planes to involve proximal groin or retroperitoneal space.","title":"Liposarcoma of the lower extremity.","pubmedId":"6252646"}
