The ALK rearrangements frequencies were: 14.8 % (16/108), 10.3 % (20/195), 7.6 % (13/170), 2.8 % (29/1035), 2.5 % (3/119), 2.0 % (11/539), 0.9 % (1/114), and 0 % (0/19) for variants of invasive adenocarcinoma, solid predominant, micropapillary predominant, acinar predominant, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, papillary predominant, lepidic predominant, and adenocarcinoma in situ, respectively.\nWe reported significant discrepancies of ALK status in lung adenocarcinoma subtypes in Chinese patients.","title":"Frequencies of ALK rearrangements in lung adenocarcinoma subtypes: a study of 2299 Chinese cases.","pubmedId":"27386342"}
