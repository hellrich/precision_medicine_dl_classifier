Endoscopic mucosal resection for intramucosal cancer and wedge resection under laparoscopy for minimal invasive cancer in the stomach have been performed. For advanced gastric cancer, extended lymph node dissection(D2) has been applied as standard treatment in Japan. However, new strategy has been required for advanced gastric cancer with distant lymph node metastasis and/or peritoneal dissemination. It is well known that gene therapy for cancer has limitation of efficacy, but we believe the new strategy will be available in post-genome era for gastric cancer treatment using 1. developing novel adenovirus, 2. usage of drug delivery system and 3. effective treatment for adverse effect.","title":"[Gastric cancer--novel strategy of gene therapy for gastric cancer].","pubmedId":"11197869"}
