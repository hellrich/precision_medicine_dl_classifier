These tumors were composed of interlacing fascicles of uniform spindle cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for CD117, CD34 and negative for S-100, smooth muscle actin. Molecular analysis for activating mutations of KIT and PDGFRA was performed in two tumors. Contrary to sporadic GISTs, the NF1-associated GISTs are characterized by rare mutations of KIT or PDGFRA. But, one missense point mutation (Trp557Gly) was identified in KIT exon 11 of the extramural portion of the largest tumor in this case. The intramural portion of the largest tumor and the other tumor had wild type KIT and PDGFRA.","title":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor with KIT mutation in neurofibromatosis type 1.","pubmedId":"22111084"}
