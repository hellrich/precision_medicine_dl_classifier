Normal liver tissue was obtained from 19 patients with metastatic liver cancer. Poly ADP-ribosylation activity of these tissues was measured by using [32P]-adenylate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-incorporation into the 116-kDa protein. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide glycohydrolase activity of these tissues was determined with thin layer chromatography. The immunohistochemical expression of Ki-67 was also assessed as a parameter of cell proliferative activity.\nThe poly ADP-ribosylation of the 116 kDa protein was significantly increased in patients with HCC and LC as compared with NL (P\u003c0.0001, P\u003c0.05, respectively) and was inhibited by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors in a dose-dependent manner. There was no significant difference in NAD glycohydrolase activity among the three groups. A significant correlation was found between the Ki-67 positive cell rate and the relative radioactivity of poly ADP-ribosylation in HCC patients (r\u003d0.794, P\u003c0.0001). The poly ADP-ribosylation of the 116 kDa protein of LC was significantly higher in patients who had recurrences of HCC after hepatic resection than in patients without recurrence (P\u003c0.05).\nPoly ADP-ribosylation of the 116 kDa protein in HCC patients might be enhanced with its proliferative activity, and poly ADP-ribosylation of the same protein in LC patients might be a useful parameter of carcinogenic potential for predicting HCC recurrence after hepatectomy in patients who have had HCC.","title":"Enhanced polyadenosine diphosphate-ribosylation in cirrhotic liver and carcinoma tissues in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.","pubmedId":"11339428"}
