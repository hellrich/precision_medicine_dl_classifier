The neoplasm was completely excised and was composed of an irregular admixture of areas of atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma of the lipoma-like subtype with areas of myxoid/round cell liposarcoma. An amplification of the MDM2 and CDK4 genes respectively in the atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma areas was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, and translocations of the CHOP and FUS genes were detected by FISH analysis in the myxoid/round cell liposarcoma areas.","title":"Mixed-type liposarcoma: clinicopathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular analysis of a case arising in deep soft tissues of the lower extremity.","pubmedId":"18551309"}
