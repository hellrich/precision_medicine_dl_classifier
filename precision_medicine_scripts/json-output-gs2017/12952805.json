HIV-positive women with severe immunosuppression are 5 times more likely than HIV-negative women to have lower genital tract neoplasias. A corresponding increase in the risk of invasive vulvar and anal cancers, but not of cervical cancer, has also been observed among HIV-positive women. Treatment failure and recurrence of neoplasia occur much more frequently among HIV-positive than among HIV-negative women. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the understanding of the relation between HIV and HPV coinfection and the development of lower genital tract neoplasias and cancers in women. In addition, we present strategies for monitoring and treating noninvasive and invasive neoplasias of the lower genital tract in HIV-positive women.","title":"Human papillomavirus and HIV coinfection and the risk of neoplasias of the lower genital tract: a review of recent developments.","pubmedId":"12952805"}
