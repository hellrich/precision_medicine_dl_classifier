In the present work, we tested the hypothesis that germline APC mutations may be present in some patients with a milder phenotype, i.e., multiple synchronous colorectal adenomas. Eighteen patients with 3 or more colorectal adenomas at endoscopy (within a 6-month period) were ascertained from a series of subjects undergoing endoscopic examination. Their blood DNAs were analysed for the presence of germline mutations in the APC coding region by single-strand polymorphism analysis. Ten unrelated polyp-free subjects and 101 unrelated APC patients were used as controls in the molecular analyses. Five of the eighteen patients carried novel germline APC variants or rare polymorphisms. These were various in site (from the splice acceptor site of intron 7 to the end of exon 15) and type (splice-site, missense, and chain-terminating mutations). Only one of ten polyp-free individuals carried a silent APC variant and none of these variants was found in the 101 APC controls. A first- or second-degree family history of colorectal cancer was reported by 4 of the 5 patients carrying a germline APC variant. In conclusion, novel APC germline variants were detected in patients with multiple synchronous adenomas. This suggests that the development of sporadic adenomas, in some instances, is associated with the presence of minor germline variants of the APC gene and that the spectrum of germline APC functional mutations may be larger than previously thought.","title":"Novel germline APC variants in patients with multiple adenomas.","pubmedId":"9669663"}
