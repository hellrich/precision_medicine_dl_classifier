In the prospective part of the study participants (n\u003d1453) were followed up for an average of 20years. Data on incident CVD (n\u003d766) were obtained from the National Population Register. For both subsamples, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) was used to measure depressive traits and somatic concerns. In addition, composite scales of general ill-being, sleep and pain problems, psychological well-being, energy level, and cheerfulness were formed.\nIn the final corrected models there were no significant associations between somatic concerns or depressive traits and IMT. Both somatic concerns and depressive traits predicted a higher CVD incidence after adjustments for age and risk factors. The association between depressive traits and CVD incidence was highest among the subgroup of men with the highest levels of hsCRP, but this result did not reach statistical significance. Of the composite scales, general ill-being predicted a higher CVD incidence in the fully adjusted model, even when all the composite scales were entered into the model simultaneously.\nSomatic concerns and depressive traits predict a higher CVD incidence. In particular, general ill-being contributes to this association. The association between depressive traits and CVD may be moderated by low-grade inflammation.","title":"Somatic concerns, depressive traits, atherosclerosis and the incidence of cardiovascular disease in ageing Finnish men.","pubmedId":"26013320"}
