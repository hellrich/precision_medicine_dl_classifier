Although RhoBTB2 was found to be frequently lost in breast cancer lines, expression status of RhoBTB2 in sporadic breast cancer tissues and its clinical and prognostic value, however, remain unclear. Tissue samples from breast cancer patients and normal controls and cell samples from cell lines were collected and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was used to monitor the presence of RhoBTB2 mRNA. The protein expression of RhoBTB2 was detected by immunohistochemical staining. Cumulative survival time was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model. We discovered that RhoBTB2 expression was lacking in a breast ductal epithelial carcinoma cell line T-47D but was expressed in other types of tumor cell lines and normal tissues we tested. The results from tissue samples showed that RhoBTB2 was absent in 60% of breast cancers on both the mRNA and protein level. The results from RT-PCR were completely uniform with those from immunohistochemistry. We demonstrated that loss of RhoBTB2 more frequently occurred in postmenopausal patients of age \u003eor\u003d50 yr old and in patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast. The prognostic value of RhoBTB2 in breast cancers also be assessed by a long-term follow-up investigation and we found that patients with RhoBTB2-negative breast cancer were linked to poor clinical prognosis. Therefore, the loss of RhoBTB2 expression is a common occurrence in breast cancers and it is an important factor in the development and prognosis of sporadic breast cancer.","title":"A novel tumor suppressor gene RhoBTB2 (DBC2): frequent loss of expression in sporadic breast cancer.","pubmedId":"19937980"}
