He was treated by percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) for obstructive jaundice. The PTBD catheter dislodged 14 days later. He underwent emergency open peritoneal lavage and external choledochal drainage for diffuse bile peritonitis. Cytologic examination of bile obtained from the T-tube revealed malignant cells. He underwent pancreatoduodenectomy with regional lymph node dissection 2 months later for ampullary carcinoma. Pathologic examination showed a macroscopic protruding, 8 x 7 x 10 mm, papillary adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater. The tumor was classified as stage II with pT2, pN0, and pM0. Eight months later, cytologic examination of ascites demonstrated adenocarcinoma cells. The patient died with peritoneal recurrence 10 months after curative pancreatoduodenectomy.","title":"Peritoneal recurrence of ampullary carcinoma following curative pancreatoduodenectomy.","pubmedId":"10626200"}
