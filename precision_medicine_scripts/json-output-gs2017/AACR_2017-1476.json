Currently, there is no available non-invasive tool to assist in the identification of the aggressive form of this disease. Cell-free nucleic acid has been tested as a potential new molecular tool that can be useful in the diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer. MicroRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs, that are shown to impact the development and progression of prostate cancer and their detection in plasma have been indicated as a promising non-invasive tool for disease screening and prognosis assessment. Among the several deregulated miRNAs that are observed in prostate cancer, the miRNA-141-3p was observed with upregulated expression levels in prostate cancer, particularly in the metastatic lesions. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to verify the diagnostic potential of miR-141 as a circulating tumor marker for prostate cancer and determine its functional role in modulating tumorigenesis in prostate cancer metastatic cell lines. MiR-141 expression analysis was performed in plasma samples of 102 prostate cancer patients without treatment and of 50 health controls by RT-qPCR. The experimental assays were performed by transfecting the PC3 cell line using miRNA-141 mimic/ inhibitor systems and directly accessing their effect in classical tumor phenotypes. Expression of the miR-141 were found significantly upregulated in the metastatic patientsâ€™ plasma specimens (FC\u003d9.11, p\u003d0.04; AUC\u003d0.66) when compared to the patients without metastasis, showing its screening potential for prostate cancer metastasis. The in vitro ectopic expression of miR-141 in PC3 cell line showed a significant increased in cell proliferation, associated with changes in cell cycle (decreased number of cells in the G1 phase). Conversely, the inhibition of miR-141 showed an increase in the migratory ability, cell adhesion and in the Docetaxel cytotoxicity of the PC3 cells. Western-blot analysis showed that the inhibition of the miR-141 levels reduced the expression of the EMT inducers markers E-CADHERIN and CLAUDIN, and up-regulated the levels of ZEB-1, pAKT and VIMENTIN, consistent with their repression roles in the EMT process. These findings showed that miR-141 presents a direct function in controlling some of the in vitro metastatic phenotypes in prostate cancer, through the regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition expression proteins. In conclusion, miR-141 presents a potential use as a minimally invasive molecular marker for prostate cancer diagnosis and can be used as a druggable target for therapy, particularly in the metastatic clinical setting.","title":"Cell-free miR-141 as a molecular marker for prostate cancer metastasis.","pubmedId":"AACR_2017-1476"}
