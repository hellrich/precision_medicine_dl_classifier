Most GISTs show gain-of-function mutations of KIT, mainly in exon 11, that always maintain the reading frame. We report on data from a 43-year-old Japanese man with recurrent duodenal GIST and a frameshift mutation in KIT exon 13 together with an in-frame deletion in KIT exon 11 detected by genomic DNA sequencing. Deletion of 48 base pairs of KIT exon 11, which preserved the reading frame, was identified in both primary and recurrent tumors, whereas deletion of one nucleotide of codon 642 of KIT exon 13, which changed the reading frame and induced a novel stop codon at amino acid 644, was found only in the recurrent tumor. The predicted protein resulting from the latter would lack part of the kinase domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documentation of a GIST with a frameshift mutation of KIT.","title":"A recurrent duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumor with a frameshift mutation resulting in a stop codon in KIT exon 13.","pubmedId":"15543597"}
