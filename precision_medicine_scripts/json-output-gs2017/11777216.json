The tumor was diagnosed as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma by closer examinations, including a percutaneous needle biopsy. Ten years previously, she had undergone excision of a choledochal cyst, with reconstruction by Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, as treatment for Todani\u0027s type Ia congenital biliary dilation, which had been confined only to the extrahepatic bile duct. The significant association between congenital biliary dilation and hepatobiliary malignancies is well known. Some patients have been reported to develop biliary cancer long after the excision of the entire extrahepatic bile duct and hepaticoenterostomy. However, in these patients, the development mostly took place in the remnant choledochal cyst, the anastomotic site, or in the dilated intrahepatic bile duct of Todani\u0027s type IV-A congenital biliary dilation. The development of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma after operation has not been reported previously in a patient with Todani\u0027s type I congenital biliary dilation. This case suggests that the entire biliary tree may have a high risk of field cancerization, even in extrahepatic congenital biliary dilation.","title":"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma arising 10 years after the excision of congenital extrahepatic biliary dilation.","pubmedId":"11777216"}
