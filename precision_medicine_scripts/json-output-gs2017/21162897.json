Then the investigators analyzed the relationship between the preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and prognosis and measured the expression of PTEN during neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.\n92.4% (61/66) of patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy as planned. 87.9% (58/66) tumor stages were down-staged, tumor size decreased while the distance from anal edge increased. And curative resection with sphincter-sparing was carried out in all patients. The rate of sphincter preservation was 90.9% (60/66). Among which, 85.5% patients showed an excellent function of sphincter. The 2-year survival rate was 87.9% (58/66). The survival period was an average of 35.3 months (range: 25-60). The PTEN mRNA and protein expression in cancer tissues on neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy were significantly higher than those before neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (P\u003d0.0079, 0.0269).\nThe preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in lower rectal cancer patients has shown its efficacy in down-staging cancer, enhancing resectability, offering sphincter preservation, up-regulating PTEN expression, promoting the apoptosis of cancer cell and achieving a better survival rate. Thus preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is an effective adjuvant measure.","title":"[Expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog in lower rectal cancer on neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy].","pubmedId":"21162897"}
