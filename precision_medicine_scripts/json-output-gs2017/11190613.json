Aim of the present study was the comparison of survival in patients resected by the classic Whipple operation (Whipple) or the pylorus-preserving procedure. From April 1986 to June 1998 all patients operated for proven diagnosis of ductal pancreatic cancer were documented prospectively concerning patient\u0027s characteristics, kind of surgery, complications and histopathological staging according to the UICC-classification of 1992. During the observation period 100 patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy, 38 cases as Whipple, 62 as PPPD. Average of age was 59.9 +/- 10.3 years without significant differences. Mortality was 6.0% in total, 5.5% post Whipple, and 6.5% post PPPD. Eighty-three percent of the resected specimen were node positive. The median survival time was 9.9 and 10.5 months, 5-year survival 2.6% and 10%, respectively without significant differences. Actually, only node positive patients reached 5-year survival. Even better survival figures following PPPD than after classic Whipple procedure make the pylorus-preserving procedure the standard operation in ductal cancer of the pancreatic head. Distal gastric resection is only mandatory in case of tumor involvement of the duodenopancreatic angle. Since only node negative cases survived 5 years, extensive surgery exceeding anatomical pancreatic head resection does not appear to be beneficial.","title":"[Stomach saving duodenopancreatectomy.
