The correlation between IGF-1/IGF-1R and LVD was investigated. Effects of IGF-1 on migration and invasion of CRC cells were examined using transwell chamber assays. A LoVo cell xenograft model was established to further detect the role of IGF-1 in CRC lymphangiogenesis in vivo.\nElevated IGF-1 and IGF-1R expression in CRC tissues was correlated with lymph node metastasis (r \u003d 0.715 and 0.569, respectively, P \u003c 0.05) and tumor TNM stage (r \u003d 0.731 and 0.609, P \u003c 0.05). A higher LVD was also found in CRC tissues and was correlated with lymphatic metastasis (r \u003d 0.405, P \u003c 0.05). A positive correlation was found between LVD and IGF-1R expression (r \u003d 0.437, P \u003c 0.05). Transwell assays revealed that IGF-1 increased the migration and invasion of CRC cells. In vivo mouse studies showed that IGF-1 also increased LVD in LoVo cell xenografts.\nIGF-1/IGF-1R signaling induces tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis and contributes to lymphatic metastasis of CRC.","title":"Insulin-like growth factor-1 induces lymphangiogenesis and facilitates lymphatic metastasis in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"24282367"}
