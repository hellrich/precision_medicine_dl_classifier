Surgical resection has proved to be the most effective therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer isolated to the liver and has yielded long term survival. However, recurrence frequently occurs within the remaining liver as well as at extra-hepatic sites. The role of adjuvant therapy has been investigated in many studies but has still been controversial until now. This review examines the incorporation of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, regional chemotherapy with hepatic arterial infusion and molecular targeted therapy following liver resection for patients with CRLM, and summarized the advantage and adverse effects for these treatments. Finally, we propose the prospective of future adjuvant treatments to further improve prognosis.
