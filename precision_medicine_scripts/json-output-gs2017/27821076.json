Mutations in the serine-threonine kinase 11 gene (SKT11) are the major cause of PJS.\nBlood samples were collected from six PJS families including eight patients. Mutation screening of STK11 gene was performed in these six families by Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay. Three novel mutations (c.721G \u003e C, c.645_726del82, and del(exon2-5)) and three recurrent mutations (c.752G \u003e A, c.545 T \u003e C and del(exon1)) in STK11 were detected in six Chinese PJS families. Genotype-phenotype correlations suggested that truncating mutations trend to result in severe complications.\nThese findings broaden the mutation spectrum of the STK11 gene and would help clinicians and genetic counselors provide better clinical surveillance for PJS patients, especially for ones carrying truncating mutation.","title":"Three novel mutations of STK11 gene in Chinese patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.","pubmedId":"27821076"}
