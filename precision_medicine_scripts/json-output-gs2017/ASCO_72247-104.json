This project aimed at the identification of frequent and new deletions in PCa and to study their association with tumor phenotype and PSA recurrence. Methods: Array CGH was performed on 77 advanced PCa. Deletions of interest were subsequently analyzed on a tissue microarray containing more than 2000 PCa with clinical follow-up data using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The FISH probes used included a break-apart probe for TMPRSS2-ERG and dual-labeling probes for centromere 10/PTEN and centromere 3/3p14. Results: The most frequent circumscribed deletions found by array CGH were 3p14 (including FOXP1) in 18%, 5q31 in 16%, 5q21 in 14%, 6q13 in 21%, 6q21 in 19%, 6q26 in 14%, 8p11 in 17%, 10q23 (including PTEN) in 18%, 12p13 in 14%, 13q14 in 14%, 16q24 in 22% and 21q (representing TMPRSS2-ERG fusion) in 18%. TMPRSS2-ERG fusions, PTEN and FOXP1 deletions were selected for FISH analysis. A TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was observed in 394 of 947 interpretable cases (41.6%). TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was unrelated to tumor stage, Gleason grade, and PSA recurrence. PTEN deletions were observed in 8.9% of 1844 interpretable cases and were associated with advanced tumor stage (p\u003c0.0001), high Gleason grade (p\u003c0.0001), and early biochemical recurrence (p\u003c0.0001). FOXP1 deletions were seen in 5.0% of 619 cases. FOXP1 deletions were not significantly linked to tumor phenotype and outcome. Both PTEN and FOXP1 deletions were strongly linked to TMPRSS2-ERG fusions. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion positive tumors had PTEN deletions in 15.4% and FOXP1 deletions in 10.7%, while TMPRSS2-ERG fusion negative cancers had PTEN deletions in only 5.8% and FOXP1 deletions in only 2.0% of cases (p\u003c0.0001 each). Conclusions: The TMPRSS2-ERG fusion determines a genetically distinct subgroup of prostate cancers. Our data provide no evidence for a particular clinical behaviour of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion positive cancers in radically operated patients. PTEN and FOXP1 alterations are preferentially found in TMPRSS2-ERG fusion positive cancers. Both genes may potentially be involved in pathway dysregulation in these cancers.","title":"Chromosomal deletions, tumor phenotype, and prognosis in prostate cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_72247-104"}
