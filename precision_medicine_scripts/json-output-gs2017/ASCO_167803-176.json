RAS mut,the most frequent oncogene alteration, is not directly targetable with agents currently available for clinical use. We studied the efficacy of chemo and immunCI in RAS mut ADC and explored a potential interaction between coexisting RAS/TP53 mut and clinical benefit. Methods: Out of 235ADC with targeted mut profiling (mass spectrometry Sequenom or Amplicon MiSeq) at out institution, 59 had RAS mut (25%). From this population, 53 were eligible for retrospective analysis of clinical endpoints. Primary objective was to determine time to treatment failure (TTF) on first-line platinum-based chemo and subsequent immuneCI. Secondary objectives were to estimate survival after relapse (SAR) according to immuneCI exposure and correlative analyses with other gene mut Results: 51pts had KRAS mut tumors, most frequent variants being G12C(21), G12V(9), G12D(6), G13(5) while 2 pts had NRAS mut tumors(Q61). Coexisting events included TP53 mut(15/24), STK11 mut(4/24) and PIK3CA mut(2/53). Out of 42 pts that received systemic therapy for metastatic disease, 34 had first-line platinum-based chemo and 17 received maintenance chemo. 10 patients received immuneCI in the relapsed setting (6 nivolumab, 3 atezolizumab, 1 pembrolizumab). Median TTF on first-line platinum based chemo plus maintenance was 6.7 months (CI95% 4.7-8.7); median TTF on single-agent immuneCI was 13.2 months (CI95% 7.1-not reached). Pts with coexisting KRAS/TP53 mut maintained the favorable outcome with immuneCI (n \u003d 6, median PFS 12.1 months). SAR was longer in pts that received immuneCI (not reached at 30 months) as compared to chemotherapy-only pts (15.2 months, CI95% 12.2-41.5; HR 0.46, log-rank P \u003d 0.19). Conclusions: RAS mutated ADC pts have favorable outcomes when exposed to standard chemo and immuneCI. Stratified correlative analyses are recommended in clinical trials assessing the benefit of immuneCI in all-comers population.","title":"Outcome of RAS mutated lung adenocarcinoma (ADC ) patients (pts) on standard chemotherapy (chemo) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (immuneCI).","pubmedId":"ASCO_167803-176"}
