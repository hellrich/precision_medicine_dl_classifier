There were 5 FISH-positive cases (7.7%, 5/65) , all with advanced stage carcinoma. Among these five FISH-positive cases, 3 were IHC-positive (4.1%, 3/74) and 2 IHC-negative cases. All the other 69 samples were IHC-negative, including nine FISH-uninformative samples (7 samples were less than 50 tumor cells and 2 samples with weak FISH signal). Both ALK IHC and FISH results were not correlated with age, sex, history of smoking, histological classification, differentiation and lymph node metastasis.\nBronchoscopic specimens of lung cancer can be used to detect ALK expression and gene fusion. Immunohistochemistry in combination with FISH test may be more favorable for ALK test.","title":"[ALK protein expression and gene fusion in bronchoscopic specimens of lung adenocarcinoma].","pubmedId":"25327654"}
