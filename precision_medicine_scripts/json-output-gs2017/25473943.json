Targeting BRAF mutations with either small molecule inhibitors of BRAF or one of the downstream mediators of oncogenic BRAF - MEK - is associated with improved outcomes compared with chemotherapy and has led to the US FDA approval of two BRAF inhibitors - vemurafenib and dabrafenib - and the MEK inhibitor trametinib. Further, the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib is well tolerated and associated with higher responses and improved survival compared with single-agent BRAF inhibitors.
