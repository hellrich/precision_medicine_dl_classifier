However, the existence of double-positive (DP) patients have been sporadically described. We identified DP cases in therapy-naive ALK-rearranged ADC and characterized the biology of these tumors to better understand the clinical response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).\nWe selected 42 ALK-positive ADCs from a multicentric series of 301 cases of ADCs. A mutational analysis was performed using Sanger and/or pyrosequencing to address exons 18-21 of EGFR and codons 12-13 of the KRAS gene. In addition, the KRAS and EGFR copy number was investigated using fluorescent in situ hybridization. DP patients were treated with TKIs, and their response was evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria.\nEight of 42 ALK-positive ADCs (19%) demonstrated a concomitant mutation in the EGFR (3 cases) or KRAS (5 cases) genes and were classified as DP. All DP cases displayed copy number gains in the EGFR or KRAS gene because of polysomy or gene amplification. In the latter cases, a mutant allele-specific imbalance was observed. Four patients were treated with TKIs. The 2 EGFR-mutant DP patients demonstrated a better response to crizotinib compared with erlotinib. The 2 KRAS-mutant DP patients experienced opposite responses to crizotinib.\nThe incidence of DP ADC is not negligible. Patients with ALK/EGFR might benefit more from crizotinib compared with erlotinib administration, although the efficacy of TKIs in patients with ALK/KRAS remains unclear. An integrated targeted therapy should be considered for patients with DP ADC.","title":"EGFR and KRAS Mutations in ALK-Positive Lung Adenocarcinomas: Biological and Clinical Effect.","pubmedId":"26381283"}
