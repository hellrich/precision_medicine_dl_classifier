The role and mechanisms by which RAS oncogenes maintain the transformed state of human cancer cells are poorly understood. Here, we have studied the role of oncogenic K-RAS in maintaining cytoskeletal disruption, cell adhesion and motility in metastatic colon carcinoma cells. Targeted deletion of K-RAS(G13D) from HCT116 colon carcinoma cells restored their ability to assemble stress fibers and focal adhesions/complexes, accompanied by increased cell-matrix adhesion and reduced motility. We further show that oncogenic K-Ras induces high Rho activity, but uncouples Rho from stress fiber formation. This uncoupling required the maintenance of high levels of the activator protein-1 family member, Fra-1, via a mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-dependent pathway. We also show that PI3-kinase signaling is required for the motility of HCT116 cells downstream of oncogenic K-Ras. Our findings suggest that mutated K-RAS oncogenes are essential for maintenance of the transformed and invasive phenotype of human colon cancer cells.","title":"Oncogenic K-RAS is required to maintain changes in cytoskeletal organization, adhesion, and motility in colon cancer cells.","pubmedId":"15735008"}
