The Mdm2 gene codes, in addition to the full-length p90(MDM2), for a short protein, p76(MDM2) that lacks the p53-binding domain. Despite this property and at variance with p90(MDM2), this protein acts positively toward p53, although the molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report that p76(MDM2) antagonizes MDM4 inhibitory function. We show that p76(MDM2) possesses intrinsic ubiquitinating and degrading activity, and through these activities controls MDM4 levels. Furthermore, the presence of p76(MDM2) decreases the association of MDM4 with p53 and p90(MDM2), and antagonizes p53 degradation by the heterodimer MDM4/p90(MDM2). The p76(MDM2)-mediated regulation of MDM4 occurs in the cytoplasm, under basal growth conditions. Conversely, upon DNA damage, phosphorylation of MDM4Ser403 dissociates p76(MDM2) and prevents MDM4 degradation. The overall negative control of MDM4 by p76(MDM2) reflects on p53 function as p76(MDM2) impairs MDM4-mediated inhibition of p53 activity. In agreement with the positive role of p76(MDM2) toward p53, the p76(MDM2)/p90(MDM2) ratio significantly decreases in a group of thyroid tumor samples compared with normal counterparts. Overall, these findings reveal a new mechanism in the control of p53 basal activity that may account for the distinct sensitivity of tissues to stress signals depending on the balance among MDM proteins. Moreover, these data suggest an oncosuppressive function for a product of the Mdm2 gene.","title":"Regulation of MDM4 (MDMX) function by p76(MDM2): a new facet in the control of p53 activity.","pubmedId":"20697359"}
