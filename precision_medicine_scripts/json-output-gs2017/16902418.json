Age- and sex-specific rates for 35 different cancer sites were calculated, and used to estimate relative risks among relatives. In addition to the well-recognized risk for melanoma among first-degree relatives, we found significantly increased risks for prostate, breast, and colon cancers, non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma, and multiple myeloma, ranging from 32 to 72% increased risk. Among second-degree relatives, in addition to increased risk for melanoma, we identified significantly increased risks for prostate cancer and multiple myeloma (27 and 53% increase, respectively). Among first-degree relatives of melanoma cases diagnosed before the age of 40 years, we found significantly elevated risks for cutaneous melanoma (380% increase) and prostate cancer (83% increase). Significantly increased risks for prostate cancer and multiple myeloma in both first- and second-degree relatives of melanoma cases are suggestive of heritable cancer syndromes. The increased risks for five additional cancer types in first-degree relatives of melanoma cases suggest that individuals with a family history of melanoma should strictly adhere to recommended screenings for all cancers.","title":"Population-based assessment of non-melanoma cancer risk in relatives of cutaneous melanoma probands.","pubmedId":"16902418"}
