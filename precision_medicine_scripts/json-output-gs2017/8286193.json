The IGF-II receptor is identical to the mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) receptor, which is involved in lysosomal enzyme pathways. In order to determine whether the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor gene copy number is altered in breast cancer we analysed specimens of invasive breast carcinoma from 51 patients by Southern blotting. No amplification of the receptor gene was observed whatever the clinical presentation of the tumour and irrespective of a concomitant amplification of c-erbB2 or int-2 genes in several tumours. As indicated by Northern blotting, the gene is transcribed in breast tumour tissues and non-tumour breast tissue. These results suggest that the receptor gene is stable in breast carcinoma and that, if anything, the receptor involvement in breast cancer progression may be the result of a disregulation of its expression at a post-transcriptional or post-translational level.","title":"Analysis of the IGF-II receptor gene copy number in breast carcinoma.","pubmedId":"8286193"}
