Here, we describe a case of dedifferentiated liposarcoma originating from a well-differentiated liposarcoma of the mesorectum that presented as a protruding mass in the rectal lumen. Hartmann\u0027s operation with total mesorectal excision was performed and the tumor was removed radically. No management guidelines are currently available for liposarcoma of the rectum. We propose that complete surgical resection be required for the treatment of rectal liposarcoma and that a long-term detailed follow up is necessary.","title":"Dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the rectum: a case report.","pubmedId":"23139616"}
