Most cases of MBC as a secondary malignancy relate to the previous treatment with ionizing radiation. MBC can be associated with mutations in hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome genes (i.e., BRCA2); however, no such association has been reported in patients with Cowden syndrome (involving the phosphatase and tensin homolog [PTEN] gene). We describe a patient with Cowden syndrome who was initially diagnosed with B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma at the age of 7 years, then MBC at the age of 31 years, and never received radiation therapy.
