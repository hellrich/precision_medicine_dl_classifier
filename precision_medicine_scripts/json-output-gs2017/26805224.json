The patient in this case was a 67-year-old woman. Abdominal CT and pelvic MRI showed a mass of 15 cm in diameter on the left side of the pelvis. Well-differentiated liposarcoma was diagnosed based on these images. Based on imaging findings, the possibility of permeation to the neighboring organs was considered to be low, and so the operation was performed laparoscopically. The location of the tumor was similar to that seen during preoperative imaging diagnosis, and we were able to remove it laparoscopically without resecting the organ. The postoperative progress was good, and the patient left the hospital on the fourth postoperative day. This case shows how with detailed preoperative imaging, a minimally invasive approach is possible for the treatment of liposarcoma.
