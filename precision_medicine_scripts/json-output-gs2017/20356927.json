BRCA2 plays a well-established role in maintaining genome stability by regulating homologous recombination. BRCA2 has more recently been implicated in cytokinesis, the final step of cell division, but the molecular basis for this remains unknown. We have used time-lapse microscopy, recently developed cytokinesis assays and BAC recombineering (bacterial artificial chromosome recombinogenic engineering) to investigate the function and localization of BRCA2 during cell division. Our analysis suggests that BRCA2 does not regulate cytokinesis in human cells. Thus, cytokinesis defects are unlikely to contribute to chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis in BRCA2-related cancers.","title":"Evidence that the tumor-suppressor protein BRCA2 does not regulate cytokinesis in human cells.","pubmedId":"20356927"}
