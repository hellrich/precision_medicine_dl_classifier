Overexpression of HGF and c-Met have been shown in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, their role in tumor progression is not clearly defined. The aim of this study is to determine the role of HGF/c-Met pathway and its association with invasion related markers and clinicopathologic parameters in NSCLC. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on 63 paraffin-embedded NSCLC tumor sections. The expressions of invasion related markers such as Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9, Tissue Inhibitor Metalloproteinase (TIMP) 1 and 3 and RhoA were also examined. Co-expression of HGF/c-Met was significantly associated with lymph node invasion and TIMP-3 and RhoA overexpressions. There were positive correlation between TIMP-3 overexpression and advanced stage and negative correlation between RhoA overexpression and survival. DNA sequencing for Met mutations in both nonkinase and tyrosine kinase (TK) domain was established. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in sema domain and two SNPs in TK domain of c-Met were found. There was no statistically significant correlation between the presence of c-Met alterations and clinicopathologic parameters except shorter survival time in cases with two SNPs in TK domain. These results suggest that HGF/c-Met might exert their effects in tumor progression in association with RhoA and probably with TIMP-3. The blockade of the HGF/c-Met pathway with RhoA and/or TIMP-3 inhibitors may be an effective therapeutic target for NSCLC treatment.","title":"HGF/c-Met overexpressions, but not met mutation, correlates with progression of non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"21779788"}
