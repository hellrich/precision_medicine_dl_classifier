A few studies have also investigated the genetic contribution of RAD51 135G\u003eC to the risk of sporadic breast cancers or breast cancer in non-BRCA1/2 carriers, though the results are yet controversial and inconclusive. We, in this study, performed a more precise estimation of the relationship between 135G\u003eC and breast cancer among non-BRCA1/2 mutation carriers by meta-analyzing the currently available evidence from the literature. A total of 12 studies involving 7,065 cases and 6,981 controls were identified. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of association. When all the studies were pooled into the meta-analysis, there was no evidence for a significant association between 135G\u003eC and breast cancer risk in non-BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (for CC vs. GG: OR \u003d 0.995, 95%CI: 0.741-1.336; for GC vs. GG: OR \u003d 0.959, 95%CI: 0.869-1.057; for dominant model: OR \u003d 0.988, 95%CI: 0.902-1.082; and for recessive model: OR \u003d 1.037, 95%CI: 0.782-1.376). We also performed subgroup analysis by ethnicity (Caucasian) as well as did analysis using the studies fulfilling Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and the results did not change. In summary, the present meta-analysis suggests that the RAD51 135G\u003eC does not modify breast cancer risk in non-BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.","title":"RAD51 135G\u003eC does not modify breast cancer risk in non-BRCA1/2 mutation carriers: evidence from a meta-analysis of 12 studies.","pubmedId":"20461453"}
