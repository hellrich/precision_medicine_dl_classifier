The number of hospital admissions for congestive heart failure rose by 71% (from 42,965 in 1980 to 73,448 in 1993) and hospitalization rates for congestive heart failure increased by 47% (from 348 per 100,000 in 1980 to 511 per 100,000 in 1993). The rise in hospitalizations was limited to persons aged \u003e or \u003d 65 years, and proved greater among women. Congestive heart failure was the leading cause of hospitalization in persons aged \u003e or \u003d 65 years, accounting for 5% of all hospital admissions in this age group. Age-adjusted congestive heart failure mortality declined by 23%. The decline affected all age groups, with the sole exception of the \u003e or \u003d 80-year group in which mortality rose. Nevertheless, congestive heart failure remained the third leading cause of cardiovascular death.\nCongestive heart failure represents a significant hospital and demographic burden for the Spanish population. The hospital burden increased substantially in the period 1980-1993, and will continue to do so in future with the growth of the elderly population.","title":"Trends in hospitalization and mortality for heart failure in Spain, 1980-1993.","pubmedId":"9402452"}
