We cultured A549 cells on matrices of 0.2, 2, and 25 kPa to mimic the rigidities of normal lung parenchyma, progressive fibrotic change, and lung fibrosis, respectively. Lung tissue from patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma was used to confirm the in vitro findings. Increased matrix rigidity promoted cell proliferation and upregulated the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met), and Snail expression in A549 cells. A549 cells became more resistant to the EGFR inhibitor (Erlotinib) and c-Met inhibitor (PHA-665752) when matrix rigidity increased; however, a high concentration of PHA-665752 reversed the rigidity-induced morphological pleomorphism. In human lung tissue, expression of type I collagen was more consistent with clinical fibrosis than the expression of alpha-smooth muscle antibody was. c-Met- and Snail-expressing tumor cells, rather than EGFR-experssing cells, were localized with lung parenchyma rich in type I collagen. Our findings suggest that c-Met causes the rigidity-induced biophysical reaction in pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Treatment targeting both EGFR and c-Met should be considered for patients with lung fibrosis and who are abundant type I collagen expression in the tumor mass.
