In order to improve EUS-guided tissue sampling a novel 19-gauge trucut-type needle has been designed to obtain core biopsies during EUS. We prospectively evaluated the safety and accuracy of EUS-FNA alone versus combined EUS-FNA and trucut needle biopsy (TNB) in patients referred to our Unit over a 3-year period.\nA total of 159 patients underwent EUS-FNA alone (lesions\u003c2 cm) or the combination of both sampling modalities (lesions\u003eor\u003d2 cm). The adequacy of sampling, sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracies of EUS-FNA or EUS-TNB alone and combined EUS-FNA/TNB were determined.\nAdequate samples were obtained by EUS-FNA, EUS-TNB and EUS-FNA/TNB in 91%, 88% and 97% of patients, respectively. From the pancreas (n\u003d83), adequate samples were obtained by FNA in 94% and by TNB in 81%, compared with 87% and 92% from non-pancreatic sites (n\u003d76), respectively. The combination of both techniques resulted in more adequate samples from non-pancreatic cases than EUS-FNA alone (P\u003d0.044). The specificity was 100%. Overall accuracy for EUS-FNA alone was 77%, for EUS-TNB alone 73% and for EUS-FNA/TNB 91% (P\u003d0.008). For pancreatic sampling, the accuracy of EUS-FNA alone was 77%, for EUS-TNB alone 56% and for EUS-FNA/TNB 83%. For non-pancreatic sampling, the accuracy for EUS-FNA alone was 78%, for EUS-TNB alone 83% and for EUS-FNA/TNB 95% (P\u003d0.006). The complication rate was 0.6%.\nCombined EUS-FNA/TNB for lesions\u003eor\u003d2 cm improves adequacy of sampling and diagnostic accuracy compared with either technique alone and is safe.","title":"Endoscopic ultrasound-guided tissue sampling by combined fine needle aspiration and trucut needle biopsy: a prospective study.","pubmedId":"16417562"}
