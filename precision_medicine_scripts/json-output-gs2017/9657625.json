The numbers (%) of subjects with DLIA levels above the detection limit of the assay used (\u003e 0.1 nmol/L) were, in the NIDDM/-HT group, 12/14 (85.7%) and in the NIDDM/+HT group, 9/12 (75%), significantly higher (P \u003c .05) than in the HV (7/20; 35%), IDDM (3/15; 20%), and HT/-HI groups (2/10; 20%). The number and percentage of subjects with DLIA levels above the detection limit in the HT/+HI group was six of eight (75%), significantly (P \u003c .05) higher than in the IDDM and HT/-HI groups, and tended to be higher than in the HV group (P \u003c .055). Means and SD of serum DLIA levels (nmol/L) in the NIDDM/-EH (0.18/0.09) and NIDDM/+EH (0.19/0.15) groups were significantly higher (P \u003c .05) than in the HV (0.09/0.07), IDDM (0.05/0.05), and EH/-HI (0.06/0.06) groups. DLIA levels in the HT/+HI group (0.15/0.12) were significantly higher (P \u003c .05) than in the IDDM and HT/-HI groups. The percentage of DLIA levels above the detection limit, as well as the mean and SD of DLIA in the NIDDM group taking OHA, did not differ from those in subjects taking insulin. In all subjects studied (n \u003d 99), DLIA correlated with C-peptide (r \u003d 0.30; P \u003c .01) and glomerular filtration (GF) (r \u003d -0.21; P \u003c .05). After exclusion of insulin-treated patients, DLIA correlated significantly with plasma glucose (PG; r \u003d 0.25; P \u003c .05), immunoreactive insulin (IRI; r \u003d 0.41; P \u003c .001), C-peptide (r \u003d 0.27; P \u003c .05), and GF (r \u003d -0.26; P \u003c .05) (n \u003d 64). Correlation of DLIA with IRI (r \u003d 0.33; P \u003c .05; n \u003d 38) also persisted after exclusion of patients taking insulin and those with DLIA levels below the detection limit. Similarly, DLIA also correlated with C-peptide (r \u003d 0.64; P \u003c .05) and IRI (r \u003d 0.70; P \u003c .05) in the subgroup of 10 patients with the highest levels of DLIA (\u003e 0.25 nmol/L). None of the sera (n \u003d 15) with different DLIA concentrations (0.0-0.38 nmol/L) exhibited K-pNPPase (Na+-K+-ATPase) inhibitory activity. In conclusion, this work demonstrated elevated serum DLIA in NIDDM and HT/+HI patients, and its correlation with IRI and GF. However, due to the fact that the chemical nature and biologic properties of DLIA are still a matter of debate, it is too early to speculate whether the elevation of DLIA is just a secondary result associated with HI and reduced GF, or whether it also has pathophysiologic consequences. Nevertheless, in both cases the elevated concentrations of substances with DLIA and their interference with antidigoxin antibodies may affect therapeutic monitoring of digitalization in NIDDM and HT/+HI patients. Also, the elevated DLIA could subclassify these patients. The significance of such subclassifications (pathophysiologic, therapeutic, or prognostic), however, will need further investigation.","title":"Endogenous digoxin-like immunoactivity in subjects with diabetes mellitus and hypertension.","pubmedId":"9657625"}
