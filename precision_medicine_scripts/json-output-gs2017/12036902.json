Matrix-CGH revealed copy number gains of numerous oncogenes, i.e., CCND1, MDM2, GLI, CDK4, MYB, ESR1, and AIB1, several of which correlate with a high level of transcripts from the respective gene. In addition, a number of genes were found differentially expressed in dedifferentiated and pleomorphic liposarcomas. Application of dedicated clustering algorithms revealed that both tumor subtypes are clearly separated by the genomic profiles but only with a lesser power by the expression profiles. Using a support vector machine, a subset of five clones was identified as \"class discriminators.\" Thus, for the distinction of these types of liposarcomas, genomic profiling appears to be more advantageous than RNA expression analysis.","title":"Microarray-based copy number and expression profiling in dedifferentiated and pleomorphic liposarcoma.","pubmedId":"12036902"}
