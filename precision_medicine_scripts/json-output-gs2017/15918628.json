Six patients were alive at the end of 5th year, 3 with early gastric carcinoma and 3 with locally advanced carcinoma. Mortality was 17 patients in the first year, 10 in second year, 8 in third year, 3 in fourth year and 1 in the fifth year.\nGastric carcinoma carries a bad prognosis. The 5-year survival rate in our series was 13.3% [corrected] Efforts should be made to diagnose and treat these patients at an early stage.","title":"Gastric carcinoma: 5 years survival after gastric surgery.","pubmedId":"15918628"}
