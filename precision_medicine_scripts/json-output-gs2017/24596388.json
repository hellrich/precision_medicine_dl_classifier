The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanisms by which up-regulation of fatty acid synthase (FAS) expression confers resistance to trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancers.\nThe expression of FAS as well as the cytotoxic effects of combinatorial treatment of trastuzumab and juglone was investigated by immunoblotting, BrdU incorporation, TUNEL assay, and soft agar assay.\nPin1 enhanced EGF-induced SREBP1c promoter activity, resulting in the induction of FAS expression in BT474 cells. In contrast, juglone, a potent Pin1 inhibitor, significantly enhanced trastuzumab-induced FAS down-regulation and cell death in BT474 cells. Furthermore, trastuzumab, when used in combination with gene silencing or chemical inhibition of Pin1, increased cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and DNA fragmentation to increase trastuzumab sensitivity.\nPin1-mediated FAS overexpression is a major regulator of trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer growth and survival.","title":"Prolyl-isomerase Pin1 impairs trastuzumab sensitivity by up-regulating fatty acid synthase expression.","pubmedId":"24596388"}
