Future clinical assessment will probably include add-on trials in which a new drug is combined with an intervention with established efficacy; this development is in turn likely to herald the use of combination regimens in clinical practice. Personalised medicine (the selection of monotherapies on the basis of individualised biomarker signal) is an intrinsically attractive alternative approach, but is unlikely to be useful in routine management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in the medium-term future because of the complex nature of the disease\u0027s pathogenesis. In this Personal View, we review the pleiotropic nature of disease pathogenesis in idiopathic pulmonary disease, the use of combination regimens in other selected chronic lung diseases, and the conceptual basis for combination therapies in interstitial lung disorders other than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. On the basis of these considerations, and the emergence of data from add-on trials, we believe that the future of management for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis lies in the development of combination regimens.
