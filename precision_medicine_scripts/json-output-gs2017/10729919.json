This study concerns 18 cases of meningeal tumours in children under the age of 16, of which 13 were meningiomas and five were other tumours arising in the meninges. Meningiomas showed a preponderance in females as in adult series, and the majority were supratentorial in localisation. The percentage of meningeal tumours and meningiomas among all brain tumours in our centre were 3.72% and 2.69%, respectively. Four out of 13 meningiomas were fibroblastic, four were transitional, one was meningothelial, two were psammomatous and two were papillary meningiomas. Seven (38.8%) out of 18 tumours showed anaplastic features, including two papillary meningiomas, two hemangiopericytomas, one mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, one pleomorphic sarcoma and one anaplastic meningeal tumour. Papillary meningiomas with hemangiopericytoma-like solid areas were seen frequently in our cases (15.3%). Meningoangiomatosis was associated with two meningeal tumours. MIB1 (Ki-67) labelling indices (LIs) ranged between 0% and 13.6% (mean 1.83%) in benign, and between 1% and 20% (mean 7.2%) in malignant tumour, including papillary meningiomas. Mean MIB-1 LIs were 5.61% and 1.14% in non-recurrent and recurrent cases, respectively. MIB-1 LIs showed significant differences between benign and malignant meningeal tumours but no significant correlation either with prognosis or recurrence. Despite the fact that brain tumours are among the most common neoplasms of childhood, meningeal tumours are rare lesions, accounting for less than 2% of published series of intracranial neoplasms in childhood [5, 8, 18, 24, 30, 32]. It has been suggested that the clinical and pathological characteristics of meningiomas in this age group differ from those of adults [14, 18, 24, 45]. Besides meningiomas, there are a few reports of other meningeal tumours in childhood and difficulties in differential diagnosis may arise within this group, especially in anaplastic tumours [11, 13, 32, 44, 46]. One of the major problems in meningiomas and some tumours arising in the meninges is the discordance that arises between the histologic appearance of the tumour and behaviour [4]. Several studies have attempted to determine the proliferation potential of meningiomas, including immunohistochemical labelling with monoclonal antibodies to Ki-67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR); flow cytometric DNA analysis; or argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs) counting [9, 10, 15, 19, 22, 26, 31, 35, 53]. The studies concerning proliferation markers have contradictory results [9, 10, 15, 26, 31, 42, 53]. MIB-1 detects the same or a similar epitope as the original antibody Ki-67 and reacts with a proliferation associated antigen expressed in all active parts of the cell cycle, G1, S, G2 and M (mitosis), but not in the G0 or quiescent phases [7]. In this study we examined the clinicopathological characteristics and MIB1 values of 18 meningeal tumours in children under the age of 16 years within the last 25 years (from 1970 to 1995).","title":"Intracranial meningeal tumours in childhood: a clinicopathologic study including MIB-1 immunohistochemistry.","pubmedId":"10729919"}
