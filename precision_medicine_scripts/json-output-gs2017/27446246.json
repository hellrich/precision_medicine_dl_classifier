A rat model of gastric mucosal injury was established through injection of a 60% acetic acid solution into the stomach. Following ulcer induction, the rats were administered BHB orally for 5 days at doses of 0, 100, 300 or 1,000 mg/kg. The highest dose of BHB was also administered with or without L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME). The area of gastric ulcers was determined by planimetry, and expression of cyclooxygenases (COX), cytokines and NOS in stomach tissues were measured using western blotting. Compared with the control group, gastric ulcer size was significantly decreased in the 1,000 mg/kg BHB-treated group (P\u003c0.05). Administration of BHB led to a significant increase in endothelial (e)NOS expression (P\u003c0.05). Although acetic acid co-treatment with L-NAME induced more severe mucosal damage, BHB decreased COX expression and tumor necrosis factor-α levels when administered with the nitric oxide inhibitor, L-NAME (P\u003c0.05). BHB exhibited protective effects in a rat model of gastric ulcers, which were associated with a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and the activation of eNOS.","title":"Benexate hydrochloride betadex modulates nitric oxide synthesis and cytokine expression in gastric ulcers.","pubmedId":"27446246"}
