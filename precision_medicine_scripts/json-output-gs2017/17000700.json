The treatment strategy for mesenteric liposarcoma is, if no distant metastases are detected, surgical resection with a wide surgical margin, often followed by radiation and/or adjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk patients. However, the efficacy of pre-operative chemotherapy is unknown. If the tumor is shrunk by pre-operative chemotherapy, we could achieve complete surgical resection, which is difficult when the tumor is too large or is invading neighboring organs. We herein describe a case of huge mesenteric liposarcoma that showed significant tumor shrinkage by pre-operative chemotherapy using doxorubicin, cisplatin and ifosfamide, allowing a margin-negative operation.","title":"A case of resected huge ileocolonic mesenteric liposarcoma which responded to pre-operative chemotherapy using doxorubicin, cisplatin and ifosfamide.","pubmedId":"17000700"}
