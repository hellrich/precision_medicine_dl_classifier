Between 1990 and 1997, 28 patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma underwent laparotomy. Resection was performed in 25 patients, and wedge resection alone in 3 patients. The liver resections consisted of right lobectomy in 5 patients, right trisegmentectomy in 1, left lobectomy in 7, extended left lobectomy in 3, hepatopancreatoduodenectomy in 2, and segmentectomy in 7. Curative resection was performed in 15 patients. Histological sections of all resected specimens were immunohistochemically stained with p53 and Ki-67 monoclonal antibodies to assess the biological behavior of the tumor cells. Cumulative survival rate and clinicopathological factors that may influence the prognosis, including biological markers (p53, Ki-67), were analyzed statistically. Patients who underwent curative resection survived significantly longer than patients who underwent noncurative resection. The median survival time of the patients who underwent curative resection was 24 months (mean, 34 +/- 8 months), with 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates of 66.6%, 44.4%, and 35.6%, respectively. The median survival time of the patients who underwent noncurative resection was 3 months (mean, 8 +/- 3 months), with 1- and 2-year survival rates of 26.7% and 13. 4%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that positive regional lymph nodes correlated significantly with poor outcome (P \u003d 0.004) and that curative resection significantly correlated with better prognosis (P \u003d 0.001). Age, sex, tumor size, degree of cell differentiation, gross type of tumor, and p53 and Ki-67 labeling index were not significantly correlated with outcome. Our findings support the concept that aggressive liver resection, along with regional lymph node dissection, be recommended for long-term survival. The validity of molecular biologic tumor markers (p53, Ki-67) as prognostic factors has not yet been clearly demonstrated.","title":"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in Korea.","pubmedId":"10398901"}
