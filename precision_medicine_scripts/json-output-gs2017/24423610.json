DNA methylation of the long interspersed nucleotide element-1, L1 (LINE-1) repetitive element is a good indicator of the global DNA methylation level, and is attracting interest as a useful marker for predicting cancer prognosis. Our previous study using more than 200 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) specimens demonstrated the significant relationship between LINE-1 hypomethylation and poor prognosis. However, the mechanism by which LINE-1 hypomethylation affects aggressive tumor behavior has yet to be revealed.\nTo examine the relationship between LINE-1 hypomethylation and DNA copy number variations, we investigated LINE-1-hypomethylated and LINE-1-hypermethylated ESCC tumors by comparative genomic hybridization array.\nLINE-1-hypomethylated tumors showed highly frequent genomic gains at various loci containing candidate oncogenes such as CDK6. LINE-1 methylation levels were significantly associated with CDK6 mRNA and CDK6 protein expression levels in ESCC specimens. In our cohort of 129 patients with ESCC, cases with CDK6-positive expression experienced worse clinical outcome compared with those with CDK6-negative expression, supporting the oncogenic role of CDK6 in ESCC. In addition, we found that the prognostic impact of LINE-1 hypomethylation might be attenuated by CDK6 expression.\nLINE-1 hypomethylation (i.e., global DNA hypomethylation) in ESCC might contribute to the acquisition of aggressive tumor behavior through genomic gains of oncogenes such as CDK6.","title":"LINE-1 hypomethylation, DNA copy number alterations, and CDK6 amplification in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","pubmedId":"24423610"}
