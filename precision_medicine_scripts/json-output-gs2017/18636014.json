We analyzed 222 adenocarcinomas of lung lacking KRAS and EGFR mutations and identified 10 adenocarcinomas with BRAF-V600E mutation. All BRAF-V600E mutations were heterozygous. There was a slight female predilection (6:4) in these elderly patients (average age 67 y) who were found to have a greater than expected incidence of intralobar satellite nodules and N2 node involvement. The adenocarcinomas were largely of mixed type with a high incidence of papillary (80%) and lepidic growth (50%). Adenocarcinomas with this clinicopathologic phenotype may be worthwhile investigating for BRAF-V600E mutation as more genetically oriented drug therapies emerge.","title":"The histopathology of BRAF-V600E-mutated lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"18636014"}
