In the treatment of early gastric cancer, endoscopic and limited surgeries have become more prevalent, whereas for advanced gastric cancer, super extended radical gastrectomy (SERG) and aggressive adjuvant therapy have been applied. Limited surgery includes wedge resection of the stomach, pylorus-preserving gastrectomy, vagus-preserving gastrectomy, and proximal gastrectomy. The purpose of these more limited techniques is usually to improve quality of life after surgery. Since Takahashi\u0027s lymph node staining method using fine activated carbon particles (CH40) made possible systematic para-aortic lymph node dissection, SERG has increased in popularity. The survival rate of patients with para-aortic lymph node metastases who underwent SERG was higher than that of patients who underwent extended radical gastrectomy.","title":"New trends in surgery for gastric cancer in Japan.","pubmedId":"8057646"}
