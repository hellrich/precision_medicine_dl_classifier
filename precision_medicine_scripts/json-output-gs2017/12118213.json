Abnormalities of the FHIT locus were found in many established cancer cell lines and tumors including breast cancer. In sporadic breast cancer, loss of heterozygosity within the FHIT gene has been observed at different frequencies and has been correlated with tumor progression. Aberrant FHIT transcripts have been reported in breast cancer. Furthermore, Fhit protein loss is correlated with prognosis. We summarized the research advances of FHIT genetic, epigenetic change and aberrant Fhit protein expression in breast cancer. Fhit protein may be a novel prognostic factor for breast cancer. FHIT gene therapy may potentially be clinically useful for treatment of breast cancer, suggesting further research involving FHIT introduction should be performed in breast cancer.","title":"The Fragile Histidine Triad gene and breast cancer.","pubmedId":"12118213"}
