Also, BRAF V600E mutation has been associated with resistance. Additional KRAS mutations are described in CRC.\nWe investigated the role of KRAS codons 61 and 146 and BRAF V600E mutations in predicting resistance to cetuximab plus irinotecan in a cohort of KRAS codons 12 and 13 wild-type patients.\nAmong 87 KRAS codons 12 and 13 wild-type patients, KRAS codons 61 and 146 were mutated in 7 and 1 case, respectively. None of mutated patients responded vs 22 of 68 wild type (P\u003d0.096). Eleven patients were not evaluable. KRAS mutations were associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS, HR: 0.46, P\u003d0.028). None of 13 BRAF-mutated patients responded vs 24 of 74 BRAF wild type (P\u003d0.016). BRAF mutation was associated with a trend towards shorter PFS (HR: 0.59, P\u003d0.073). In the subgroup of BRAF wild-type patients, KRAS codons 61/146 mutations determined a lower response rate (0 vs 37%, P\u003d0.047) and worse PFS (HR: 0.45, P\u003d0.023). Patients bearing KRAS or BRAF mutations had poorer response rate (0 vs 37%, P\u003d0.0005) and PFS (HR: 0.51, P\u003d0.006) compared with KRAS and BRAF wild-type patients.\nAssessing KRAS codons 61/146 and BRAF V600E mutations might help optimising the selection of the candidate patients to receive anti-EGFR moAbs.","title":"KRAS codon 61, 146 and BRAF mutations predict resistance to cetuximab plus irinotecan in KRAS codon 12 and 13 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"19603018"}
