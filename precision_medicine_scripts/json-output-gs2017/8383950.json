The treatment schedule consisted of cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on day 1, carboplatin 200 mg/m2 on day 1, and etoposide 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 3, 5 every 3 or 4 weeks. The response rate and toxicities were evaluated in 28 patients, who were diagnosed and treated in the Cancer Institute Hospital (GANN-KEN) from March 1991 to September 1992. Partial response (PR) was found in sixteen out of 28 patients (57.1%). In myelotoxicities, 5 out of 28 patients (17.9%) showed grade 4 thrombocytopenia, but, white blood cell count and hemoglobin level stayed at grade 3 or milder in most patients, revealing safety of this regimen. In gastrointestinal toxicities, the median number of days in the patients suffered from nausea and loss of appetite was about 3 and 7 days, respectively. Median weight loss of the patients through the entire treatment was 2.3 kg. These results suggest that CPVP regimen is no less effective, but more tolerable, in other words, more favorable in QOL than standard regimens, and that it warrants further study in phase III trials.","title":"[Phase II study of a novel combination regimen composed of cisplatin, carboplatin and etoposide against unresectable non-small cell lung cancer].","pubmedId":"8383950"}
