This study was designed to provide information regarding the frequencies of cancers through sample data retrieved from histopathology (surgical pathology) laboratory based cancer registry from two laboratories in Mymensingh. All malignant tumours recorded in 2006 in the register of pathology laboratory of Mymensingh Medical College and one private pathology laboratory in Mymensingh town were taken as sample data for analysis in terms of age groups, gender and types of cancer with relation to site. A total of 470 cases diagnosed as cancer were found in the register, of which males were 249(53%) and females were 221(47%) with male to female ratio 1.2: 1. Highest numbers of cases were found in the age group of 51-60 years. In male group frequency of malignant tumours was found in the age group of 51-60 years and the female group it is 41-50 years. Top five sites of cancer, irrespective of sex, were of stomach, uterine cervix, colo-rectum, lymph nodes and breast. According to decreasing order of frequency, in the males, the top five cancers were of stomach, lymph node, oesophagus, urinary bladder and colo-rectum. In the female groups these were of uterine cervix, breast, ovary, colo-rectum and stomach. Cancer cases in the age group of 51-60 years were significantly higher in males than in females (p\u003c0.001). The commonest cancers in males and females were of stomach and cervix, respectively. As the analysis was based only on surgical specimens, the exact incidence of cancer of lung and liver could not be evaluated. Because, majorities of the malignancies in these organs are diagnosed mainly on cytological examination. Population-based cancer registry should be maintained to explore the exact patterns of cancer in the study region. Cervical cancer screening program and eradication of H. pylori infection program may be helpful for the reduction of incidence of cancer in this region.","title":"Histopathology based cancer pattern in Mymensingh region of Bangladesh.","pubmedId":"17703153"}
