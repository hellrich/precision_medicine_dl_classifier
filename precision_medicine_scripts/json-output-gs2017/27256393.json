The expression of IICs and the mutational status of the genes were correlated with tumour recurrence and survival, and results were validated in an independent cohort.\nCD15+ neutrophils, CD20+ B cells and CD206+ tumour-associated macrophages were seen frequently in tumours, and their presence was associated with reduced survival in a cohort of 79 patients. Expression of CD4+ T helper cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and CD117+ mast cells was associated with a favourable prognosis. A weighted Cox regression recurrence-predictive model was constructed that showed good correlation of IICs and gene mutations. A combination of CD15, CD206, CD117 and Smad4 expression was independently associated with overall (hazard ratio (HR) 3·63, 95 per cent c.i. 2·18 to 6·04; P \u003c 0·001) and recurrence-free (HR 2·93, 1·81 to 4·75; P \u003c 0·001) survival. These findings were validated in an independent cohort (151 patients) and in 54 tissue samples obtained by preoperative endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration.\nPDAC has a unique immunosuppressive phenotype that is associated with characteristic gene mutations, disease recurrence and survival after pancreatectomy. Surgical relevance The immune microenvironment plays a critical role in the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). PDAC is associated with mutations in major driver genes, including KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A/p16 and SMAD4/DPC4. This study shows that the microenvironment of PDAC has a unique immunosuppressive phenotype, which may be driven by oncogene mutations. Patients with PDAC with a highly immunosuppressive profile tended to have poor postoperative survival. A model including three intratumoral infiltrating immune markers (CD15+, CD206+ and CD117+) and a SMAD4 mutation can be used to predict recurrence and survival in patients after surgery for PDAC.","title":"Infiltrating immune cells and gene mutations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"27256393"}
