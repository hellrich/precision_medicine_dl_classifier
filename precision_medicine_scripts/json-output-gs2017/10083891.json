A number of factors are able to affect the incidence and severity of chemotherapy-induced anemia: the type of chemotherapy, chemotherapy dose-intensity, chemotherapy duration, prior treatment, baseline Hb value and entity of Hb decrease during chemotherapy. An impaired erythroid marrow response to erythropoietin (EPO) and reduced EPO levels in response to anemia may contribute to the development of this form of anemia in lung cancer patients. Recombinant human EPO has been successfully used in the treatment of anemia. EPO increases the red cells mass and eliminates by approximately 50% the need for blood transfusions in patients with chronic anemia of cancer. EPO is also effective in the prevention of anemia of cancer patients. Besides increasing the levels of hemoglobin, EPO is also able to significantly improve the quality of life and performance status of anemic patients with cancer. EPO is well tolerated and the only drawbacks are represented by its cost and the need for a prolonged parenteral treatment. The use of EPO can be optimized by taking into consideration some predicting factors, by modulating the dose and by using iron support. In patients with lung cancer, the objective of EPO treatment may vary from palliation to survival improvement according to stage, type of antineoplastic treatment and prognosis. To take maximum advantage from its efficacy, EPO treatment in lung cancer patients needs to be individualized by identifying for each patient the risk of severe anemia and the objective of treatment.","title":"[Epoietin alfa in lung cancer].","pubmedId":"10083891"}
