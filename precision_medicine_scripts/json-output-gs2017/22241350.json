One of every 16 women is anticipated to eventually suffer from breast cancer. However, unlike the incidence rate, the mortality rate of breast cancer is low, and the 5-year survival rate is about 80%. Mammography screening has been shown to be effective, but the screening rate is still low(20-30%), compared to screening rates for other organs. To increase the screening rate, the Japanese government has introduced free breast cancer screening. To make the system for breast cancer screening more efficient, we should determine the risk factors for Japanese women, and conduct such screening at public expense.","title":"[Breast cancer].","pubmedId":"22241350"}
