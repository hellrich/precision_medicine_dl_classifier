Non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma cancer exhibits higher resistance to chemotherapy than small cell lung cancer, which requires novel strategies. To further understand underlying mechanisms for non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma cancer cell proliferation, we explored the role of Meis1 in non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma cancer cells. The results show that Meis1 inhibits non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell proliferation. Specific knockdown of Meis1 resulted in strengthened proliferative ability of non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma cancer cells. Cell cycle analysis indicated that DNA synthesis was increased when Meis1 was down-regulated specifically. As well as histone H3 phosphorylation, which is indicative of mitosis. More importantly, forced Meis1 expression repressed the proliferation of non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma cancer cell. These data demonstrated Meis1 limits the proliferation of non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma cancer cell and could potentially represent a therapeutic strategy that may control non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma cancer cell proliferation.
