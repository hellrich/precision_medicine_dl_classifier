This study was aimed for the clarification of COX-2 expression and its biologic roles in ampulla of Vater cancer. Fourty-six patients with ampulla of Vater cancer were enrolled and their COX-2 expression and clinicopathologic features were analyzed. The median age of patients was 60 yr and the mean duration of follow-up was 35 months (range: 14-82 months). Immunohistochemical stainings for COX-2, Ki-67, CD34 and TUNEL staining were performed. The immunoreactive COX-2 expression was present in 24 (52.2%) patients of ampulla of Vater cancer and mainly localized in cytosolic and perinuclear region. There was no significant difference in the length of survival between COX-2 postive and negative group (p\u003d0.9420 by Log Rank test). Also, there were no significant differences of proliferation index (p\u003d0.326), apoptotic index (p\u003d0.764) and microvessel density (p\u003d0.135) between COX-2 positive and negative group. Initial pTNM stage (p\u003d0.0028 by Log Rank test) and blood transfusion over 4 pints during operation (p\u003d0.0254 by Log Rank test) were independent prognostic factor in patients with ampulla of Vater cancer. It is suggested that immunoreactivity of COX-2 is not correlated with clinicopathologic and biologic features of ampulla of Vater cancer.","title":"Expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and its correlation with clinicopathologic factors of ampulla of vater cancer.","pubmedId":"12692419"}
