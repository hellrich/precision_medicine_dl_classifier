For patients with unresectable disease, treatment options are limited and lack curative potential. Preclinical mouse models of PDAC that recapitulate the biology of human pancreatic cancer offer an opportunity for the rational development of novel treatment approaches that may improve patient outcomes. With the recent success of immunotherapy for subsets of patients with solid malignancies, interest is mounting in the possible use of immunotherapy for the treatment of PDAC. Considered in this unit is the value of genetic mouse models for characterizing the immunobiology of PDAC and for investigating novel immunotherapeutics. Several variants of these models are described, all of which may be used in drug development and for providing information on unique aspects of disease biology and therapeutic responsiveness.
