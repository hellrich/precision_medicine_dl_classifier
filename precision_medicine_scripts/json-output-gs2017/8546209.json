Epithelial expression of HGF mRNA was particularly intense in regions of ductal epithelial hyperplasia. Positive expression of HGF (but not HGFR) mRNA was also found in adipocytes, endothelial cells, and to varying degrees in stromal fibroblasts. In 12 of 12 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ and infiltrating ductal carcinoma, carcinoma cells showed a heterogeneous pattern of expression for both HGFR and HGF mRNA. In infiltrating ductal carcinomas, intense expression of HGFR mRNA was not restricted to ductular structures but as also seen in non-duct-forming carcinoma cells. The same zones of the tumors (most commonly at the advancing margins) that expressed strongly HGFR mRNA often were also strongly positive for HGF mRNA, suggesting a possible autocrine effect. The expression pattern of HGFR protein in 25 cases including the same series of tissues used for in situ hybridization analysis was similar to that of HGFR mRNA, as determined by an immunoperoxidase technique. The finding that HGFR is expressed by both benign and malignant epithelium, and its not restricted to duct-forming structures, suggests that, although the potential for HGF/HGFR binding is maintained in malignancy, the response to ligand binding at the level of the receptor or the cellular response to receptor activation may change at some point during progression.","title":"Coexpression of hepatocyte growth factor and receptor (Met) in human breast carcinoma.","pubmedId":"8546209"}
