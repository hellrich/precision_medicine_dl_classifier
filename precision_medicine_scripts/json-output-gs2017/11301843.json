Carboplatin (Paraplatin) is a platinum analog devoid of many of the nonhematologic toxicities associated with cisplatin. Although few direct comparisons have been made, when administered by area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) dosing, carboplatin is probably equivalent to cisplatin in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer and provides an improved therapeutic index. Based on its favorable toxicity profile, carboplatin has supplanted cisplatin for use in combination with paclitaxel in several different tumor types. Initial trials combining gemcitabine and carboplatin using standard days 1, 8, and 15 dosing of gemcitabine suggested that thrombocytopenia was problematic. More recently, 21-day schedules in which gemcitabine is administered only on days 1 and 8 have demonstrated both efficacy and improved toxicity profiles. Here we review recent studies investigating gemcitabine plus carboplatin and preliminary data regarding combinations of gemcitabine with the new platinum analog oxaliplatin.","title":"Gemcitabine in combination with new platinum compounds: an update.","pubmedId":"11301843"}
