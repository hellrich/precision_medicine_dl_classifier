Neuroimaging showed an enhancing intra-axial mass in the right superior temporal region associated with severe peritumoral oedema. Preliminary diagnosis was cerebral metastasis. The mass was surgically removed. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry showed the mass to be an intraparenchymal meningioma, which is rare. The relevant literature is reviewed.","title":"Intraparenchymal meningioma.","pubmedId":"15993076"}
