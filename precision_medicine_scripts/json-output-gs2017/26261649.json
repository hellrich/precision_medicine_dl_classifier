Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by the chi-squared test, which was adopted to analyze the association between MDM2 rs769412 and rs937283 polymorphisms and the susceptibility to larynx carcinoma in the drinking population.\nGenotypes distributions of MDM2 rs769412 and rs937283 polymorphisms in the control group were in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). MDM2 rs769412 GG genotype and G allele significantly increased laryngeal carcinoma risk (GG vs. AA: OR\u003d3.17, 95% CI\u003d1.25-8.04; G vs. A: OR\u003d1.88, 95% CI\u003d1.24-2.84). Furthermore, the mutant genotypes of MDM2 rs937283and rs769412 were remarkablely associated with the increased risk for laryngeal carcinoma in drinking population (rs937283: OR\u003d2.67, 95% CI\u003d1.40-5.07; rs769412: OR\u003d3.76, 95% CI\u003d1.62-8.75).\nMDM2 polymorphisms are correlated with the onset of laryngeal carcinoma. The relationship is strengthened by alcohol drinking.","title":"Association between MDM2 rs769412 and rs937283 polymorphisms with alcohol drinking and laryngeal carcinoma risk.","pubmedId":"26261649"}
