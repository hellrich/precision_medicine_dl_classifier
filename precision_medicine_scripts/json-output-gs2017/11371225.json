HER-2/neu gene alterations have been the most frequently assessed prognostic factors during the last 10 years in breast cancer and have recently emerged as a management decision tool and a therapeutic target. There is still controversy over the best method to determine whether a tumor is HER-2/neu positive. Because of the increasing demand for HER-2/neu gene status determination in clinical practice, we compared HER-2/neu gene alterations at the DNA level (gene amplification) and the protein level (overexpression) in a panel of patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer who had received local radiotherapy alone, with no adjuvant therapy.\nWe tested 100 excised lymph node-negative breast tumors, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a biotinylated HER-2/neu DNA probe and immunohistochemical assays (IHC) with 2 different antibodies.\nThe FISH frequency of HER-2/neu gene amplification was 15%, and the IHC frequency of overexpression was 21%.\nAlthough HER-2/neu amplification by FISH and HER-2/neu overexpression by IHC correlated well in this panel of lymph node-negative breast carcinomas, there were a number of discordant cases, pointing to the important need for determining HER-2/neu alteration for the future management of HER-2/neu-based clinical applications.","title":"Fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical assays for HER-2/neu status determination: application to node-negative breast cancer.","pubmedId":"11371225"}
