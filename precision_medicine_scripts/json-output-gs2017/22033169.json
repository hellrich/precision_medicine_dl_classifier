The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility, safety, and long-term prognosis of PSD with regional lymphadenectomy in the treatment of early-stage (pTis/pT1) Amp Ca with or without regional lymph node metastasis.\nBetween May 2005 and November 2009, 31 consecutive patients with Amp Ca were enrolled in this study; 25 underwent PSD. A retrospective control group of 28 patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) for Amp Ca during the same period was established. These 2 groups were matched in terms of demographic data, tumor size, and TNM classification.\nIn the PSD group, 9 patients (36%) had regional lymph node metastasis, and 23 patients (92%) had R0 resection. Patients who underwent PSD achieved favorable results in intraoperative blood loss, duration of hospital stay, and morbidity rate. The 3-year overall and disease-free survival in PSD group were 72% and 61%, respectively. There were no differences in hospital mortality and long-term survival between the 2 groups, even for patients with lymph node metastasis (N1).\nPSD with regional lymphadenectomy is feasible and safe in the treatment of pTis/pT1 Amp Ca with or without regional lymph node metastasis. Long-term survival and morbidity rates are also favorable. PSD can be performed as an alternative of PD in selected patients with Amp Ca.","title":"Pancreas-sparing duodenectomy with regional lymphadenectomy for pTis and pT1 ampullary carcinoma.","pubmedId":"22033169"}
