The expression and significance of SDF-1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) have not been systematically studied.\nWe examined the expression of SDF-1 by immunohistochemistry using a mouse anti-human SDF-1/CXCL12 antibody (dilution 1:300) and a tissue microarray consisting of 72 stage II PDAs from pancreaticoduodenectomy specimens. The staining results were categorized as SDF-1-high (SDF-1-H; cytoplasmic staining of â‰¥10% of tumor cells) or SDF-1-low (SDF-1-L; no staining or staining of \u003c10% of tumor cells). The results of SDF-1 expression were correlated with clinicopathologic parameters and survival. Statistical analyses were done using SPSS software.\nOf the 72 stage II PDAs, 25 (35%) showed high levels of SDF-1 expression. The median overall and recurrence-free survival for patients with SDF-1-H PDAs were 26.1 and 11.1 months, respectively, compared with 44.3 and 22.3 months for patients with SDF-1-L tumors (log-rank test, P \u003d 0.047 and P \u003d 0.021). In multivariate analysis, high SDF-1 expression correlated with poor overall and disease-free survival (P \u003d 0.02 and P \u003d 0.02) independent of tumor size, differentiation, and lymph node status.\nHigh levels of SDF-1 expression were associated with poor overall and disease-free survival in patients with stage II PDA. SDF-1 may serve as a useful prognostic marker for stage II PDA.\nOur results suggest that SDF-1-CXCR4 or SDF-1-CXCR7 pathways may represent a potential target for therapeutic intervention as well as prediction of prognosis in PDA.","title":"High levels of expression of human stromal cell-derived factor-1 are associated with worse prognosis in patients with stage II pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"20732965"}
