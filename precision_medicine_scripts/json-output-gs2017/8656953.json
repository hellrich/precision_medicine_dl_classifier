Magnetic resonance images and audiologic data on 22 patients with NF2 who underwent multiple studies at the National Institutes of Health between 1983 and 1993 were reviewed to determine the growth characteristics of ANs in these patients. The average growth rate of ANs in NF2 patients was 0.30 cm3 per year and was significantly higher in older patients (0.75 cm3 per year) than in younger ones (0.12 cm3 per year). Larger ANs were more commonly found in patients with concomitant spinal tumors or meningiomas. NF2 patients with spinal tumors but not meningiomas demonstrated faster growth rates than patients without additional tumor burden. The data from this study suggest that older patients or patients with associated spinal tumors have faster growing ANs and therefore should be followed closely and treated aggressively.","title":"Growth rate characteristics of acoustic neuromas associated with neurofibromatosis type 2.","pubmedId":"8656953"}
