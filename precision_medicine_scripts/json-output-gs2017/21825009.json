Imatinib and sunitinib are very effective in advanced GIST, but have no curative potential. The observation that heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibition results in KIT degradation prompted us to assess the efficacy of the HSP90 inhibitor retaspimycin hydrochloride (IPI-504) alone or in combination with imatinib or sunitinib in two GIST xenografts with distinctive KIT mutations. Nude mice were grafted with human GIST carrying KIT exon 13 (GIST-882; n \u003d 59) or exon 11 (GIST-PSW; n \u003d 44) mutations and dosed with imatinib (50 mg/kg twice daily), sunitinib (40 mg/kg once daily), IPI-504 (100 mg/kg 3 times per week), IPI-504 + imatinib, or IPI-504 + sunitinib. We evaluated tumor volume, proliferation and apoptosis, KIT expression and activation, as well as adverse events during treatment. Treatment with IPI-504 alone resulted in tumor regression, proliferation arrest, and induction of tumor necrosis. We documented downregulation of KIT and its signaling cascade in IPI-504-treated animals. Treatment effects were enhanced by combining IPI-504 with imatinib or sunitinib. On histologic examination, liver damage was frequently observed in animals exposed to combination treatments. In conclusion, IPI-504 shows consistent antitumor activity and induces KIT downregulation in GIST, as a single agent, and is more potent in combination with imatinib or sunitinib. The sequence of drug administration in the combination arms warrants further studies.","title":"The heat shock protein 90 inhibitor IPI-504 induces KIT degradation, tumor shrinkage, and cell proliferation arrest in xenograft models of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","pubmedId":"21825009"}
