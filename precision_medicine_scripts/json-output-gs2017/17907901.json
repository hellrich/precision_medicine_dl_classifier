He had a past medical history of asthma and presented with cough, shortness of breath, fever and chest pain. The chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly and a interstitial pattern. The echocardiogram revealed a severe pericardial effusion that required performing a pericardiocentesis. A CT scan showed mediastinal adenopathies and reticulonodular interstitial pattern. A bronchoscopy could not be completed because of non-tolerance. Finally a lung biopsy allowed us to reach a final diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. Following, some aspects of lung cancer in young people are commented, especially its incidence, histology, symptoms and a prognosis. A few aspects of the interstitial lung disease are also addressed and the differential diagnosis with lymphangitic carcinomatosis.","title":"[Lung adenocarcinoma feigning an interstitial lung disease in a 30-year-old man].","pubmedId":"17907901"}
