Loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 10 and mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN on 10q are molecular hallmarks of glioblastomas. Recently, mutations were identified in PIK3CA, encoding a protein that antagonizes the function of PTEN protein in the PI3K/Akt pathway. To address the question whether an exclusive mutation pattern can be observed in PIK3CA and PTEN, we determined the frequency of mutations in both genes. All coding exons were examined by single strand confirmation polymorphism and direct sequencing. Additionally, we analyzed chromosome 10 for loss of heterozygosity and evaluated the mutational status of TP53. In 70 glioblastomas, 5 (7%) PIK3CA mutations and 10 (14%) PTEN mutations were found. All mutations in PIK3CA located to exons 1, 9 and 20, thereby supporting the concept of mutational hot spot regions. In all but one glioblastoma, mutations were seen either in PIK3CA or in PTEN. In conclusion, the frequency of PIK3CA mutations in glioblastomas appears to be much lower than initially reported.","title":"PIK3CA mutations in glioblastoma multiforme.","pubmedId":"15924253"}
