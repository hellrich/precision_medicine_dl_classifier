To assess this hypothesis, we analyzed TP53 mutations and downregulation of p14(arf), a negative regulator of p53 activated by oncogenic signals, in a retrospective series of 96 patients with primary adenocarcinoma of the lung.\nMutations in TP53 (exons 4-9), KRAS (exon 1), and EGFR (exons 18-21) were identified by direct sequencing of DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded resected tumors. Expression of p14(arf) was semiquantitatively evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis.\nTP53, KRAS, and EGFR mutations were detected in 42 of 93 (45.2%), 15 of 95 (15.8%), and 31 of 90 (34.4%) cases, respectively. Low p14(arf) expression was observed in 19 of 91 cases (20.9%). Disruption of the p53/p14(arf) pathway (defined as TP53 mutation or decreased p14(arf) expression, or both) was observed in 18 of 31 EGFR-mutated (58.1%) tumors and in 9 of 13 KRAS-mutated (69.2%) tumors.\nInactivation of the p53/p14(arf) pathway is common but not systematic in EGFR- or KRAS-mutated lung adenocarcinomas. Our work highlights the need to better investigate the association between EGFR and KRAS mutations and alterations in tumor suppressor pathways.","title":"Mutation of TP53 and alteration of p14(arf) expression in EGFR- and KRAS-mutated lung adenocarcinomas.","pubmedId":"24169260"}
