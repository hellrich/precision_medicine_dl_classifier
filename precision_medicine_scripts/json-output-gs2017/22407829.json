Next to adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung is the most frequent histologic subtype in non-small cell lung cancer. Encouraging new treatments (i.e., bevacizumab, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and ALK inhibitors) have afforded benefits to patients with adenocarcinoma, but unfortunately the same is not true for SCC. However, many genomic abnormalities are present in SCC, and there is growing evidence of their biologic significance. Thus, in the short term, the molecular characterization of patients with SCC in modern profiling platforms will probably be as important as deciphering the molecular genetics of adenocarcinoma. Patients with SCC of the lung harboring specific molecular defects that are actionable (e.g., fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 amplification, discoidin domain receptor 2 mutation, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase amplification) should be enrolled in prospective clinical trials targeting such molecular defects.","title":"Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung: molecular subtypes and therapeutic opportunities.","pubmedId":"22407829"}
