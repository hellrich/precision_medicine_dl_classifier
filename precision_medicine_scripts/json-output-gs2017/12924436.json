This sophisticated technique offers the opportunity of rapid and contamination-free tissue sampling for RNA- or DNA-based molecular genetic studies. We have applied laser microdissection to a molecular genetic study of pancreatic intraductal lesions (PanINs) in tissues of chronic pancreatitis, where an exact microdissection of small ducts within a dense fibrous tissue is of paramount importance for following analysis. From nine patients suffering from chronic pancreatitis, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens were laser microdissected, and a total of 202 normal ducts and PanINs of grade PanIN-1A to grade PanIN-2 were harvested. After whole genome amplification by improved primer extension and preamplification PCR (I-PEP-PCR), microsatellite-PCR based loss of heterozygosity analysis (LOH) of the tumor suppressor gene loci TP53, p16INK4, and DPC4 was performed. One of 85 informative duct lesions (1.2%) had LOH of TP53, 1 of 76 duct lesions (1.3%) had LOH of DPC4, and 2/29 duct lesions (6.9%) showed LOH of p16INK4. Microsatellite instability (MSI) was seen in 2 of 178 duct lesions (1.1%). Immunohistochemical staining of p53 protein and DPC4 protein revealed no aberrant expression. These preliminary data indicate that LOH of tumor suppressor genes, important in pancreatic cancer genesis or MSI, can be found in chronic pancreatitis tissues, but their incidence is low.","title":"Laser microdissection of small tissue samples--application to chronic pancreatitis tissues.","pubmedId":"12924436"}
