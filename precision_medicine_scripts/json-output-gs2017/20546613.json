The intensity of VEGF and PTEN staining and the proportion of cells staining were scored.\nThe tumor grade was not significantly related to PTEN expression, but it was to VEGF expression (p \u003d 0.400; p \u003d 0.015, respectively). While there was no significant relationship between PTEN expression and tumor size and cartilage invasion (p \u003d 0.311, p \u003d 0.128), there was a significant relationship between the severity of VEGF expression and tumor size (p \u003d 0.006) and lymph node metastasis (p \u003d 0.048) but not cartilage invasion (p \u003d 0.129). MVD was significantly higher in high-grade tumors (p \u003d 0.003) but had no significant relationship between MVD, lymph node metastasis, and cartilage invasion (p \u003d 0.815, p \u003d 0.204). There was also no significant relationship between PTEN and VEGF expression (p \u003d 0.161) and between PTEN and VEGF expression and the MVD (p \u003d 0.120 and p \u003d 0.175, respectively).\nIncreased VEGF expression may play an important role in the outcome of squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. PTEN expression was not related to VEGF expression and clinicopathological features of squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.","title":"Poor prognostic clinicopathologic features correlate with VEGF expression but not with PTEN expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.","pubmedId":"20546613"}
