Collision cancers are very rare in the pancreas and periampullary region. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical and pathological features and prognosis of collision cancer in the pancreas and periampullary region.\nPatients with collision cancers of the pancreas and periampullary region (n\u003d 10) who had undergone radical surgery were retrospectively studied. Their clinical and pathological features were summarized and the prognostic data were compared with patients with pancreatic adenocarcinomas who underwent radical surgery (n\u003d 87) and with patients with pancreatic or periampullary malignancies who underwent palliative surgery (n\u003d 89).\nCompared with other cancers at these sites, collision cancer presents no specific clinical features. However, the median survival period of patients with such malignancies was only 10.0 months, which was much less than those with pancreatic adenocarcinomas who underwent radical surgery (27.0 months) and those who received a palliative operation (20.9 months) only.\nCollision cancers of the pancreas and periampullary region are difficult to diagnose preoperatively. Their prognosis is poor even after radical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy were given.","title":"Survival analysis of pancreatic and periampullary collision cancers.","pubmedId":"20649736"}
