ERCP revealed the parasite as a \"rail-like\" linear defect in the main bile duct, and permitted its extraction. The ampullary tumor was repeatedly ablated with a snare and finally surgically removed because of suspicion of malignancy. This is the first report on such an association.","title":"Biliary ascariasis combined with a villous tumor of the papilla. Diagnostic and therapeutic value of endoscopy.","pubmedId":"3691405"}
