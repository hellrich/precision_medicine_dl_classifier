All consecutive patients received cetuximab and irinotecan or panitumumab alone for chemorefractory disease.\nNo ALK translocations or amplifications were detected. ALK gene copy number gain was found in 25 (37%) tumors. Response rate was significantly higher in patients with disomic ALK as compared to those with gain of gene copy number (70% vs. 32%; p \u003d 0.0048). Similarly, progression-free survival was significantly different when comparing the two groups (6.7 vs. 5.3 months; p \u003d 0.045). A trend was observed also for overall survival (18.5 vs. 15.6 months; p \u003d 0.885).\nGain of ALK gene copy number might represent a negative prognostic factor in mCRC and may have a role in resistance to anti-EGFR therapy.","title":"Gain of ALK gene copy number may predict lack of benefit from anti-EGFR treatment in patients with advanced colorectal cancer and RAS-RAF-PI3KCA wild-type status.","pubmedId":"24691006"}
