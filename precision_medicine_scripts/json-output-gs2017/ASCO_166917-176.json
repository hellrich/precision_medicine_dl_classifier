However, it is believed that additional intrinsic factors play a role in determining the potential of response to immunotherapy. Toward this goal we investigated the relationship between mutation profile and PD-L1 expression in lung and colorectal cancers. Methods: Molecular profiling using a panel of gene 24 genes was performed by next generation sequencing (NGS) on 158 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 42 colorectal cancers. The genes studied included ERBB2, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, SRC, JAK3, ERBB4, ERBB2, and SMAD4. In addition, these tumors were studied for the expression of PD-L1 using immunohistochemistry (IHC). PD-L1 expression was performed using standard IHC approach using SP142 clone (Spring Biosciences). Results: The level of PD-L1 expression was significantly (P \u003d 0.0005) lower in colorectal cancer as compared with NSCLC. The NSCLC cohort had significantly (P \u003d \u003c 0.0001) more cases with 3 or more genes mutated as compared with colorectal cancer. However, there was no significant difference in TP53 mutation frequency between the two tumor types. There was no correlation between PD-L1 expression and the presence or absence of 3 or more gene mutations in either NSCLC or colorectal cancer. However, PD-L1 expression was significantly (P \u003d 0.01) higher in tumors with TP53 mutation in the NSCLC cohort, but not in the colorectal carcinoma cohort (P \u003d 0.5). This was true whether PD-L1 level was used as a continuous variable or if it was dichotomized at 20% (P \u003d 0.02) or 40% (P \u003d 0.03) cutoffs. Conclusions: There is significant difference between NSCLC and colorectal cancers in PD-L1 expression levels. More importantly, TP53 mutation in NSCLC correlates with the expression of PD-L1 protein, but not in colorectal cancer despite similar rate of mutation of the TP53 between the two tumor types. This suggests a possible difference in the mechanism of regulating PD-L1 expression between the two tumor types.","title":"PD-L1 expression correlation with TP53 gene mutation status in lung cancer but not in colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"ASCO_166917-176"}
