Obviously exploring the worth of some potential markers in this setting is warranted. The purpose of this study was to investigate the predictive value of the presence of K-RAS and B-RAF mutations on the outcome of patients with mCRC treated with FOLFIRI and bevacizumab combination therapy.\nA total of 172 patients with mCRC were evaluated. K-RAS and B-RAF mutations were analyzed by quantitative PCR. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared utilizing chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests, respectively.\nForty-four percent (N\u003d77) of the patients were found to harbor K-RAS mutations and 6 (7.5%) were positive for B-RAF mutations. In baseline no difference in PFS and OS was observed between the groups with or without K-RAS mutation. No relationship was established between K-RAS and B-RAF mutation status and baseline CEA and CA19-9 tumor markers levels.\nK-RAS and B-RAF mutations do not seem to be predictive of treatment outcome as potential biomarkers for bevacizumab therapy in mCRC. However, not only the presence of K-RAS and B-RAF mutations but also the different biological behavior of the various subtypes of mutations should be considered as potential determinants in the final outcome of this disease.","title":"The role of K-RAS and B-RAF mutations as biomarkers in metastatic colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"23613396"}
