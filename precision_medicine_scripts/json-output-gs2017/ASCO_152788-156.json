Treatment of localized cSCC is effective but the response to systemic therapy for metastatic disease is inadequate. CGP of 99 advanced stage cSCC was undertaken to identify GA associated with targeted therapeutic options relevant to the systemic treatment of cSCC.  Methods:   DNA was extracted from 99 FFPE cSCC clinical specimens. Hybridization captured libraries of 236 (FoundationOne, n \u003d 66) or 305 (FoundationOne, n \u003d 33) genes, plus select introns frequently rearranged in cancer were sequenced to high ( \u003e 450x), uniform coverage. HPV16 and HPV 18 viral sequences were detected, but other hrHPVs were not assayed. All classes of genomic alterations (base subs, small in/dels, rearrangements, and copy number alterations) were evaluated and reported. CRGA were defined as GA associated with on-label targeted therapies and targeted therapies in mechanism-driven clinical trials.   Results:    99 samples (54% primary,45% metastasis) from women (avg 47.7y) with predominantly advanced stage cSCC were profiled. 368 total GA were identified (3.7 GA per tumor) involving 80 different genes, of which 257 were CRGA (2.57 per tumor). 91% of cSCC cases featured \u003e 1 CRGA, including 67 (67%) cases with CRGA in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. The most common CRGAs observed were: PIK3CA (41%), MLL2 (18%), PTEN (16%), STK11 (14%), FBXW7 (11%), FGFR3 (4.6%), ERBB2 (4.6%), KRAS (4.6%). To date, we are aware of one patient with abdominal and thoracic nodal metastases and a CGP-identified inactivating mutation in FBXW7 who showed a 6-months partial response to everolimus treatment. FGFR3-TACC3 gene fusions were rarely identified (3%); one late lung recurrence case showed stable disease on a multikinase inhibitor targeting FGFR.  Conclusions:    Most advanced stage cSCC demonstrate CRGAs, most commonly in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, and clinical response to mTOR inhibition can be achieved. Other driver events, including FGFR3 fusions, present alternatives for targeted therapy. Patients who have exhausted other SOC for metastatic cSCC have achieved clinical benefit from CGP-directed therapeutic decision-making.","title":"Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) to identifiy targeted therapy options.","pubmedId":"ASCO_152788-156"}
