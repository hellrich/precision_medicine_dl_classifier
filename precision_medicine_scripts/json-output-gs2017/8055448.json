It has been classified as an intermediate grade tumor with a definite metastatic potential but a relatively indolent natural history. Little is known about its sensitivity to chemotherapy.\nThe authors reviewed their experience with chemotherapy in ML from 1986 to 1992. The patient population was identified through a search of the database maintained by the Department of Melanoma-Sarcoma Medical Oncology of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.\nForty-four patients each with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of ML were identified. Twenty-one were treated with chemotherapy. The median age was 45 years (31-69 years); there were 14 men and 7 women. The ML in 19 patients was in the lower extremity, one in the head and neck, and one pelvic. The median size of the primary tumor was 15 cm (range, 7-48 cm) in maximum dimension. Of the 18 patients who received doxorubicin- and dacarbazine-based chemotherapy as a frontline regimen [median of 3 (2-9) cycles] and were evaluable for response, 8 (1 completed response, 7 partial responses) achieved an objective response (44%, 95% confidence interval 21-67%). Two of the remaining three patients who were also treated with a similar regimen were not evaluable for response (one received chemotherapy postoperatively, and the other received concomitant radiation and doxorubicin), and the third patient received ifosfamide as frontline chemotherapy because of a significant cardiac history. Seven patients received chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting, 13 for recurrent or metastatic disease, and 1 postoperatively after complete tumor resection. At the last follow-up, 10 patients were alive with no evidence of disease, 3 were alive with disease, and 8 had died. The median follow-up was 51 months (range, 6-199 months) from diagnosis.\nThe authors conclude that doxorubicin- and dacarbazine-based chemotherapy is effective in the treatment of ML.","title":"Myxoid liposarcoma.
