PET results were compared with those of conventional diagnostic imaging procedures. After primary treatment, 52 MTC patients with elevated serum tumor marker levels and/or general symptoms (diarrhoea/flush) underwent radiological (CT/MRI), 131-iodine labeled metaiodo-benzylguanidine (MIBG) whole-body scintigraphy and FDG PET investigations. At least one pathological lesion was detected in 49 patients by PET, 35 by CT, 32 by MRI and 3 by MIBG. FDG PET was far superior to the other methods in identifying metastases in the supradiaphragmatic lymphatic regions. In the follow-up of MTC patients, FDG PET was more sensitive in localizing tumorous LN involvement, especially in the cervical, supraclavicular and mediastinal lymphatic regions, compared to other imaging modalities.","title":"[FDG PET scan of metastases in recurrent medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland].","pubmedId":"12077916"}
