An alternative strategy to standard analyses of the resected surgical specimen is to directly examine plasma for evidence of residual disease. Recently, ctDNA has shown promise as a blood biomarker in advanced colorectal cancer; here we explore the potential of this marker in stage II CC.   Methods:  In this prospective study, plasma samples are being collected at 4-10 weeks post-op in 250 stage II CC pts, with serial 3 monthly samples on a subset of 175 pts. Adjuvant CTX is at clinician discretion, blinded to ctDNA analysis. Surveillance includes 3 monthly CEA and 6 monthly CT imaging for 2 years. All samples were sent to Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, where tumor tissue was analyzed for hotspot mutations in TP53, APC, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, CTNNB1, SMAD4, and FBXW7 using a massively parallel sequencing platform (Safe-SeqS). The identified mutation was queried and quantified in plasma using the same platform, blinded to clinical data.   Results:  Preliminary data is available on 78 of the 190 pts enrolled to date. Median age is 66 years, 25/78 (32%) received adjuvant CTX. At least 1 mutation was found in all tumors, with matching ctDNA detectable in 6/78 (7.7%) plasma samples. 10 (12.8%) recurrences have occurred at a median follow-up of 507 days, including 5 of 6 pts with detectable ctDNA and 5 of 72 with no detectable ctDNA (Table). Pts with detectable ctDNA had a shorter recurrence-free survival (median 234 days vs undefined, HR 23.09, log-rank p \u003c 0.0001). In an exploratory analysis of the correlation between ctDNA and clinicopathologic features, detectable ctDNA maintained prognostic significance, including for T3 tumors (HR for time to recurrence 80.55, log-rank p \u003c 0.0001).   Conclusions:  Early data suggests ctDNA is a promising marker of recurrence risk in stage II CC. Preliminary analyses suggests this may be independent of clinicopathologic features.RecurrenceNo recurrenceTotalPost-op ctDNA positive516Post-op ctDNA negative56772Total106878Fishers exact P \u003c 0.0001.
