Immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to evaluate the amplification and expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF-D, VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2, VEGFR-3, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in a tissue microarray of 292 colorectal adenocarcinomas. The expression of EGFR, VEGF, VEGF-D, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 was detected in 5.1%, 10.0%, 6.8%, 5.2%, and 57.2%. EGFR expression was associated with angioinvasion (p \u003c 0.05) and lymph node metastasis (p \u003c 0.005). VEGFR-3 expression was higher in the rectum than in the colon (p \u003c 0.05). VEGF expression correlated with VEGF-D (p \u003c 0.05) and VEGFR-3 (p \u003c 0.005) expression, while VEGF-D expression showed no significant association with VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3. EGFR amplification was present in 10.6% and was not associated with EGFR protein expression. VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 expression levels were related to poor patient survival. Stage, perineural invasion, and lymph node metastasis were independent prognostic factors based on a Cox analysis. VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 expression are markers of a poor prognosis in patients with surgically resected colorectal adenocarcinoma, whereas EGFR has a minor influence.","title":"Prognostic significance of epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor in colorectal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"21635552"}
