Our aim was to identify microRNAs that are deregulated in GIST, have a role in GIST pathogenesis, and could potentially be used as therapeutic tool.\nDifferentially expressed microRNAs between primary GIST (n\u003d50) and gastrointestinal leiomyosarcomas (GI-LMS, n\u003d10) were determined using microarrays. Selected microRNA mimics were transfected into GIST-882 and GIST-T1 cell lines to study the effects of microRNA overexpression on GIST cells. Luciferase reporter assays were used to establish regulation of target genes by selected microRNAs.\nMiR-17-92 and miR-221/222 cluster members were significantly (P\u003c0.01) lower expressed in GIST vs GI-LMS and normal gastrointestinal control tissues. MiR-17/20a/222 overexpression in GIST cell lines severely inhibited cell proliferation, affected cell cycle progression, induced apoptosis and strongly downregulated protein and--to a lesser extent--mRNA levels of their predicted target genes KIT and ETV1. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed direct regulation of KIT and ETV1 by miR-222 and miR-17/20a, respectively.\nMicroRNAs that may have an essential role in GIST pathogenesis were identified, in particular miR-17/20a/222 that target KIT and ETV1. Delivering these microRNAs therapeutically could hold great potential for GIST management, especially in imatinib-resistant disease.","title":"MiR-17-92 and miR-221/222 cluster members target KIT and ETV1 in human gastrointestinal stromal tumours.","pubmedId":"23969726"}
