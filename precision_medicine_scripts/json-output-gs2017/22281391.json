They affect all segments of the digestive tract. They develop from the interstitial cells of Cajal. Mutations in the Kit gene is present in 86% of cases and in PDGFR gene in 15% of cases. The marker CD 117 is present in 95% of cases. Surgery is the standard treatment in localized forms. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib is standard in first-line metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors, as well as adjuvant treatment after surgery. Sunitinib is the standard in second line.","title":"[Gastrointestinal stromal tumors].","pubmedId":"22281391"}
