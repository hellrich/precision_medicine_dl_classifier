We have not observed an alteration in either N-myc or N-ras in any of the samples studied. We have seen a 2-fold amplification of L\u003dmyc in DNA from one infiltrating ductal (ID) carcinoma, but otherwise we have seen no alterations to this gene. Amplification of c-myc was seen in 22% of ID breast carcinoma sample. Levels of amplification ranged from 2- to 10-fold. We have found a significant (p less than 0.02) correlation between an altered c-myc gene and a very poor short-term prognosis. Amplification of neu was seen in 19% of ID breast carcinomas, but the levels of amplification were higher than those seen for c-myc. Alterations to neu also correlated well with poor short-term prognosis (p less than 0.0002). Finally, we have observed a low level of amplification of c-myc in DNA from a benign fibrocystic breast lesion. This lesion exhibited some features characteristic of those thought to be associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer.","title":"Alterations to either c-erbB-2(neu) or c-myc proto-oncogenes in breast carcinomas correlate with poor short-term prognosis.","pubmedId":"3330785"}
