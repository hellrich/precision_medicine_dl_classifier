There are conflicting data on the prevalence of BRAF mutations and EGFR and HER2 gene amplification in colorectal KRAS wild type patients. In our study we tried to evaluate these expressions and their relationship to future treatment assays. Clinical-pathological data and paraffin-embedded specimens were collected from 186 patients who underwent colorectal resections at General Yag√ºe Hospital in Burgos, Spain. KRAS and BRAF status was analyzed by real-time PCR in all patients. EGFR and HER2/NEU gene amplification was detected using fluorescent in situ hybridisation technique (FISH) in 38 KRAS and BRAF wild type patients. KRAS mutations were present in 48% of the colorectal cancer patients. BRAF mutations were present in 6.25% of the KRAS wild type patients. EGFR and HER2 gene amplification was observed in 5.3% and 26.3%, respectively, of KRAS and BRAF wild type colorectal cancer patients. HER2, but not EGFR gene amplification, was frequently observed in KRAS and BRAF wild type colorectal cancer patients. These data indicate that HER2 amplification could be one of the genes to be considered in the therapeutic management of colorectal cancer.","title":"KRAS, BRAF, EGFR and HER2 gene status in a Spanish population of colorectal cancer.","pubmedId":"20563851"}
