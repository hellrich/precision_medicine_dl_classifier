Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) have the highest accuracy in detection of pancreatic cancer. MRI and EUS have similar accuracy in determining the local extent of pancreatic cancer. Angiography, computed tomography (CT) angiography and EUS are similarly accurate in evaluating peripancreatic vascular involvement. MRI is the superior method for detecting liver metastases and peritoneal implants of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) are used to assess the biliary tract of patients with pancreatic cancer. Positron emission tomography (PET) is useful in distinguishing pancreatic cancer from focal pancreatic inflammation.","title":"Radiologic diagnosis and staging of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"11335092"}
