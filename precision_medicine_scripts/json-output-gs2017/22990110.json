Detection of breast cancer metastasis at the earliest stage is important for the management and prediction of breast cancer progression. Emerging techniques using the analysis of circulating tumor cells show promising results in predicting and identifying the early stages of breast cancer metastasis in patients. Additionally, a deeper understanding of the metastatic cascade in breast cancer will be critical for developing therapeutic interventions to combat breast cancer metastasis. In this review, the current and novel methods for detection of breast cancer metastasis, as well as the mechanisms involved in metastasis and the treatment of breast cancer metastasis, are discussed.","title":"Breast cancer metastasis.","pubmedId":"22990110"}
