Workup revealed left hydronephrosis secondary to obstruction, which was caused by a recurrent liposarcoma in the intraluminal ureter. She underwent a left nephroureterectomy for symptomatic palliation. Pathologic study revealed high-grade liposarcoma. Despite negative surgical margins, the tumor rapidly recurred, leading to death only 4 months after surgery. This case highlights the aggressive nature of liposarcoma.","title":"Liposarcoma presenting as an intraluminal ureteral mass.","pubmedId":"12736039"}
