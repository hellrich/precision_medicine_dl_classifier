N-myc was amplified in two of the 15 patients with stage I to III NB and in 10 of the 36 patients with stage IV neuroblastoma over 1 year of age. Conclusions from the analysis are as follows: first tumor samples obtained on previously treated patients are histologically modified and detection of N-myc amplification is not accurate; consequently N-myc amplification must be defined at diagnosis. Surgical biopsies of the primary tumors can, however, be delayed and malignant cells obtained by ultrasound-guided punctures or analyzed on bone marrow samples if they represent more than 50% of the total population. Second, any attempt to define the prognostic value must be performed on a group of patients treated with a new aggressive protocol of chemotherapy; it will require a multiparametric analysis including, in particular, results of an extensive clinical staging at diagnosis and histological criteria.","title":"Clinical value of N-myc oncogene amplification in 52 patients with neuroblastoma included in recent therapeutic protocols.","pubmedId":"2591453"}
