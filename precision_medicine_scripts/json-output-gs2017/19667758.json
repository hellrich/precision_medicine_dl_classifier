This novel function expands the previously understood function of cdk6 as a regulator of G(1) phase of the cell cycle. The proposed mechanisms of these functions both require nuclear localization. That is, cdk6 phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) to regulate cell cycle, and the recently proposed transcriptional regulation to block differentiation, are both nuclear functions that predict nuclear localization of the kinase. This report provides a thorough analysis of cdk6 localization and compares the localization of a commonly used mutant cdk6 to the corrected wildtype sequence as recorded in GenBank. The widely shared mutant of cdk6 contains a tyrosine residue at amino acid 224 (instead of an aspartic acid) introducing a potential phosphorylation site to the cdk6 sequence. Results indicate a majority of cdk6 is localized to the cytoplasm with concentrations of cdk6 in the edges of the cytoplasm and in the cytoplasmic extensions of cells. The results of this study may help to better understand the emerging roles of cdk6 in cell cycle control, differentiation and cancer.","title":"Distinct subcellular distribution of cyclin dependent kinase 6.","pubmedId":"19667758"}
