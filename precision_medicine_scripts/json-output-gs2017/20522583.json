In the setting of pulmonary hypertension, there are social inequalities and geophysical aspects in this region that account for a high prevalence of certain etiologies. This review aimed to analyze some of these factors. Data were collected from the existing literature. Information also was obtained from local tertiary-care centers to where patients with pulmonary hypertension generally are referred. Further, local experience and expertise was taken into consideration. Three etiologies of pulmonary hypertension were found to be the most prevalent: schistosomiasis (approximately 1 million affected people in Brazil), high altitude (particularly in the Andes), and congenital heart disease (late diagnosis of congenital left-to-right shunts leading to development of pulmonary vasculopathy). The diversity in terms of ancestries and races probably accounts for the differences in phenotype expression of pulmonary hypertension when a given region is considered (eg, schistosomiasis-, high-altitude-, or congenital heart disease-associated pulmonary hypertension). Governmental measures are needed to improve social and economic inequalities with an obvious impact on certain etiologies, such as schistosomiasis and congenital heart disease. Early diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension and access to medication remain important challenges all over Latin America.","title":"Pulmonary hypertension in Latin America: pulmonary vascular disease: the global perspective.","pubmedId":"20522583"}
