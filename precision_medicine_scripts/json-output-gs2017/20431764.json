The overall survival time of the entire cohort (n\u003d330) was median 3.9 months (range; 0.2 to 67.1). The survival time was significantly shorter in the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma group (3.0+/-5.3 months) than in the hilar cholangiocarcinoma group (5.9+/-10.1 months; Kaplan-Meier survival analysis). Multivariate analysis revealed that distant metastasis was a poor prognostic factor for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (p\u003c 0.001), baseline serum albumin \u003e3.0 g/dL was a favorable prognostic factor (p\u003d0.02), and baseline serum carcinoembryonic antigen level \u003e30 ng/mL was a poor prognostic factor for hilar cholangiocarcinoma (p\u003d0.01).\nThe median survival of advanced unresectable cholangiocarcinoma is dismal.","title":"Natural History and Prognostic Factors of Advanced Cholangiocarcinoma without Surgery, Chemotherapy, or Radiotherapy: A Large-Scale Observational Study.","pubmedId":"20431764"}
