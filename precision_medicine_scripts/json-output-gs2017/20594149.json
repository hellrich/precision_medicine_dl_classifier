NF2 mutations are primarily encountered in spinal lesions. In contrast, NF2 alterations do not seem related to tumor grade. We studied the NF2 expression through a real-time polymerase chain reaction in 25 pediatric anaplastic ependymomas. We compared the NF2 expression in neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissues, in supratentorial and infratentorial ependymomas and in primitive and non-primitive tumors (recurrences and metastases). Statistical analysis did not prove significant differences. Our results suggest that NF2 alterations are not typical of intracranial anaplastic ependymomas.","title":"Merlin expression in pediatric anaplastic ependymomas real time PCR study.","pubmedId":"20594149"}
