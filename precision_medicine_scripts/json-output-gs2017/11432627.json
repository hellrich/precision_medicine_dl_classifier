This study was designed to test the efficacy of the leucovorin 5-FU and gemcitabine combination.\nThis phase II trial combined a simplified bimonthly LV5FU2 with gemcitabine: leucovorin 400 mg/m2 in a two-hour infusion, followed by 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 bolus and 2 or 3 g/m2 continuous infusion over 46 hours; gemcitabine 1 g/m2 was infused over 30 min on day 3 after 5-FU. Treatment was repeated every two weeks. Gemcitabine dose could be increased (250 mg/m2 every two cycles up to 1500 mg/m2) in the absence of NCI-CTC toxicity \u003e 2.\nAmong the 62 patients included in this study, 22 had LA and 40 had metastatic disease. Objective response rate for the 54 patients with measurable disease was 25.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 14%-37.8%) and 22.6% (95% CI: 12%-33.2%) in the intent-to-treat population: the clinical benefit rate for the 59 assessable patients was 49.2%. Median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 4.8 and 9 months, respectively, with 32.3% of patients alive at 1 year. The most frequent toxicity (grade 3-4) was neutropenia (56.5%) usually asymptomatic (1.1% febrile neutropenia), but requiring decreases of 5-FU and gemcitabine doses. Unexpected complete alopecia occurred in 97% of patients.\nPalliative effects, response rate and survival observed in this multicenter study seem to be superior to those obtained with gemcitabine or 5-FU alone, despite a limiting hematological toxicity.","title":"Phase II trial of bimonthly leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine for advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (FOLFUGEM).","pubmedId":"11432627"}
