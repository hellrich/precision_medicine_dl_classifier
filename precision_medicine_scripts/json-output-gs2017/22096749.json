Middle-preserving pancreatectomy is a recently reported alternative procedure when the pancreatic body is spared from disease.\nWe report a 63-year old lady who underwent a combined Whipple\u0027s operation and distal splenopancreatectomy for her synchronous ampullary carcinoma and solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the distal pancreas.\nFor multiple tumors of the pancreas, the choice of surgery should be based on the nature of pathology and follow the principle of oncological resection.\nMiddle-preserving pancreatectomy is a safe and feasible option for patient with multicentric or synchronous pancreatic pathologies.","title":"Middle-preserving pancreatectomy for synchronous ampullary carcinoma and solid-pseudopapillary tumor of distal pancreas.","pubmedId":"22096749"}
