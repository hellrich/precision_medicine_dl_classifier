From a functional screen for identifying genes responsible for tamoxifen resistance in human ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 17 was recovered. The aim of this exploratory study was to assess the predictive value of FGF17 and the receptors FGFR1-4 for the type of response to tamoxifen treatment (clinical benefit) and the duration of progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with recurrent breast cancer. mRNA levels of FGF17 and FGFR1-4 were quantified by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR in 285 estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinomas with clinical follow-up. All patients had recurrent disease and were treated with tamoxifen as first-line systemic therapy for local or distant relapse. FGF17 and FGFR1-3 mRNA levels had no significant predictive value for this group of patients. However, high FGFR4 mRNA levels analyzed as a continuous log-transformed variable predicted poor clinical benefit (odds ratio\u003d1.22; P\u003d0.009) and shorter PFS (hazard ratio\u003d1.18; P\u003c0.001). In addition, in multivariable analysis, the predictive value of FGFR4 was independent from the traditional predictive factors. Our analyses show that FGFR4 may play a role in the biological response of the tumor to tamoxifen treatment. In addition, as altered expression of FGF17 causes tamoxifen resistance in vitro, the FGF signaling pathway could be a valuable target in the treatment of breast cancer patients resistant to endocrine treatment.","title":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 predicts failure on tamoxifen therapy in patients with recurrent breast cancer.","pubmedId":"18310279"}
