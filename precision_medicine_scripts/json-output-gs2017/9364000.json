We genotyped 213 lung adenocarcinoma patients and 219 healthy blood donor subjects for five polymorphic markers mapping in the putative region of interest. Three marker polymorphisms, located in a region spanning approximately 700 kb, were significantly associated with lung adenocarcinoma risk. Furthermore, polymorphisms in KRAS2 and PTHLH loci were also associated with tumor prognosis. These results suggest the existence of a human Pas1 homologous locus on chromosome 12p12.","title":"Association of chromosome 12p genetic polymorphisms with lung adenocarcinoma risk and prognosis.","pubmedId":"9364000"}
