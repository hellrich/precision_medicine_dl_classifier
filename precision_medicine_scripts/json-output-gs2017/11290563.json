It is currently thought that the main action of HGF is of a paracrine nature: HGF produced by mesenchymal cells acts on epithelial cells that express its receptor c-MET. In this investigation, we explored the significance of c-MET expression in myofibroblasts, both in culture and in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. We first showed that human myofibroblasts derived from primary lung cancer expressed c-MET mRNA and protein by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Proliferation of myofibroblasts was stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by exogenously added recombinant human HGF whereas it was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by neutralizing antibody to HGF. The addition of HGF in the culture medium stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-MET. The c-MET protein was immunohistochemically detected in myofibroblasts in the invasive area of lung adenocarcinoma. Finally, the prognostic significance of c-MET expression in stromal myofibroblasts was explored in patients with small-sized lung adenocarcinomas. c-MET-positive myofibroblasts were observed in 69 of 131 cases (53%). A significant relationship between myofibroblast c-MET expression and shortened patient survival was observed in a whole cohort of patients including all pathological stages (two-sided P: \u003d 0.0089 by log-rank test) and in patients with stage IA disease (two-sided P: \u003d 0.0019 by log-rank test). These data suggest that the HGF/c-MET system constitutes an autocrine activation loop in cancer-stromal myofibroblasts. This autocrine system may play a role in invasion and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma.","title":"c-MET expression in myofibroblasts: role in autocrine activation and prognostic significance in lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"11290563"}
