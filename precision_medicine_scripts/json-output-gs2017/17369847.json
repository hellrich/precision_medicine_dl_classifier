PTEN counteracts the functions of many growth factors, the most prevalent of which is insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II). PTEN expression is stimulated by IGF-II forming a feedback loop. Investigating IGF-binding protein (IGFBP) modulation of IGF-II actions on MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we found that IGFBP-2 also regulates PTEN. The MCF-7 cells were not responsive to high doses of IGF-II due to induction of PTEN, which was not observed with an IGF-II-analog that does not bind to IGFBPs or in the presence of an inhibitor that prevents IGFs associating with IGFBPs. These cells predominantly produce IGFBP-2: blocking IGFBP-2 with a specific antibody, or preventing IGFBP-2 binding to integrins, restored the induction of PTEN and the cells were non-responsive to high doses of the IGF-II-analog. Our findings indicate that breast cancer cells do not respond to high doses of IGF-II due to induction of PTEN, but IGFBP-2, when free from IGF-II can suppress PTEN. Levels of IGFBP-2 are elevated frequently in human tumors: its ability to regulate PTEN could have important implications in relation to therapeutic strategies targeting growth factor pathways.","title":"IGF-II and IGFBP-2 differentially regulate PTEN in human breast cancer cells.","pubmedId":"17369847"}
