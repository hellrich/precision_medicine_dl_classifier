To analyze K-Ras function, we have searched for K-Ras interacting proteins and found IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) as a novel K-Ras binding protein. IQGAP1 has been known as a scaffold protein for B-Raf, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. Here we showed that IQGAP1 selectively formed a complex with K-Ras but not with H-Ras, and recruited B-Raf to K-Ras. We found that IQ motif region of IQGAP1 interacted with K-Ras. Both active and inactive K-Ras interacted with IQGAP1, and effector domain mutants of K-Ras also associated with IQGAP1, indicating that IQGAP1 interacts with K-Ras irrespective of Ras-effectors like B-Raf. We also found that overexpression or knock-down of IQGAP1 affected the interaction between K-Ras and B-Raf, and IQGAP1 overexpression increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in K-Ras dependent manner in PANC1 cells. Our data suggest that IQGAP1 has a novel mechanism to modulate K-Ras pathway.
