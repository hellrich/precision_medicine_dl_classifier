Over the past three decades, the genetics of lung cancer has been progressively delineated. Small molecule drugs or monoclonal antibodies have been developed that target and inactivate specific cancer-related proteins, such as growth factor receptors or their kinases. This article will review the therapeutic implications of molecular changes associated with non-small cell lung cancer and the status of targeted therapies in its treatment.","title":"Targeted therapy for non-small cell lung cancer.","pubmedId":"16253823"}
