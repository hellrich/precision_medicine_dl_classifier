All the clinicopathologic data, the follow-up information and the status of gene mutations including EGFR, KRAS, HER2, BRAF, AKT1, ALK, RET and ROS1 were investigated.\nOf the 133 lung adenocarcinomas with lepidic pattern, 87.22 % (116/133) were detected harboring mutations in our tested genes, among which 90.52 % (105/116) harbored EGFR mutation. There are three KRAS mutations and two BRAF mutations in our cohort, and we revealed two ALK fusion and one RET fusion. No ROS1 fusion was discovered. There was no significant difference in gene mutations between adenocarcinomas with pure lepidic component and lepidic predominant adenocarcinomas except EGFR mutation (p \u003d 0.039). Lepidic predominant adenocarcinomas seemed to have more EGFR mutation. The post-recurrence survival was significantly prolonged in patients who received TKIs.\nAdenocarcinoma with lepidic pattern is a low-grade lung tumor with favorable prognosis and displays frequent EGFR mutation. Compared with lepidic predominant adenocarcinomas, lung adenocarcinomas with pure lepidic component have a better prognosis. On the basis of these results, we also suggested the application of EGFR-TKIs therapy for EGFR mutation-positive patients after recurrence could achieve prolonged survival.","title":"Comprehensive study of mutational and clinicopathologic characteristics of adenocarcinoma with lepidic pattern in surgical resected lung adenocarcinoma.","pubmedId":"27738759"}
