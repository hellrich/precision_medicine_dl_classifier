The study by Moertel et al that showed that the combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and levamisole in the adjuvant setting reduced mortality by 33% in stage III colon cancer; 5-FU/leucovorin (LV) became the standard of care in the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer after it showed superiority to 5-FU/levamisole. However, no standard schedule of 5-FU/LV has been established. The fortnightly regimen of bolus 5-FU/LV and continuous infusion 5-FU (LV5FU2) has the same efficacy as and is less toxic than the monthly regimen of bolus 5-FU/LV. Oxaliplatin combined with 5-FU and LV (FOLFOX4) is the first combination to demonstrate significant superiority in 3-year disease-free survival as compared with 5-FU/LV in the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer. Three-year disease-free survival is an excellent predictor of 5-year overall survival and, in future studies, can serve as a reliable endpoint that is associated with reproducible 5-year overall survival. Results of studies testing irinotecan combined with 5-FU and LV are not yet available. Adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage II colon cancer is a controversial subject. Because the available data suggest that stage II patients benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, although to a lesser extent than patients with stage III disease, all patients with stage III and high-risk stage II disease should be offered adjuvant treatment with the new standard of care, FOLFOX4. Future studies in adjuvant therapy for colon cancer will explore oxaliplatin and 5-FU with or without antiangiogenesis or anti-epidermal growth factor agents.","title":"An overview of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy for colon cancer.","pubmedId":"15212702"}
