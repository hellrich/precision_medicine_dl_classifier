NEAT1 is a recently identified lncRNA with its function largely unknown in human malignancy. In the present study, we investigated NEAT1 expression in 239 cases of clinical colorectal cancer specimens and matched normal tissues. Statistical methods were utilized to analyze the association of NEAT1 with clinical features, disease-free and overall survival of patients. Results showed that NEAT1 expression in colorectal cancer was up-regulated in 72.0% (172/239) cases compared with corresponding normal counterparts, and related to tumor differentiation, invasion, metastasis and TNM stage. Kaplan-Meier analysis proved that NEAT1 was associated with both disease-free survival and overall survival of patients with colorectal cancer that patients with high NEAT1 expression tend to have unfavorable outcome. Moreover, cox\u0027s proportional hazards analysis showed that high NEAT1 expression was an independent prognostic marker of poor outcome. These results provided the first evidence that the expression of NEAT1 in colorectal cancer may play an oncogenic role in colorectal cancer differentiation, invasion and metastasis. It also proved that NEAT1 may serve as an indicator of tumor recurrence and prognosis of colorectal cancer.
